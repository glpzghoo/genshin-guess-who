I can make whatever you want, even if it\'s not on the menu!"\\nThe workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first sentence out of their mouths.\\nA customer that orders without needing a menu has been at least a few times before. However, if they ask "Is Xiangling the chef today?" then they\'re definitely a regular.',

Either the insides would become irreversibly charred from the heat of a Pyro Slime, or cracks would appear due to flash-freezing from a Mist Flower — or, at some step in Xiangling's unconventional cooking process, a small-scale explosion would reduce it to scrap metal. After some heavy consideration on the part of Xiangling's father, he ultimately decided not to banish his daughter from the kitchen, despite the destruction she caused.\\nAs reckless, imaginative, and uninhibited as she may be, it was exactly these traits that led her to create her most successful dishes. \"Maybe this isn't so bad...\" He tried to convince himself.\\nSuffice to say that payment for a new wok is a regular feature of the restaurant's monthly ledger.",

That line was written on the title page.\\nIf she was any other person, she would likely have regarded it as some cheesy inspirational quote. However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.\\nTo her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the Li and Yue cuisines by upholding that principle.\\nHowever, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception.\\n"Good food is good food, period!"\\nThe monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as matsutake and crabs infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.\\nIt was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes.\\n"I\'m gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!"',
