As such, please add Her Excellency\'s emblem — the Electro Mitsudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would."\\n"Haha, just wait for it!" ___ replied, agreeing with great confidence.\\nBefore the show could begin, ___ ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival\'s finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.\\nYet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if ___ had made an error in her arrangements.\\nIt was only after speaking with ___ that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an "angling" trick added to it.\\nIf viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun\'s house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.\\nOf course, how could ___ miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.\\nWith ___ around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, "Queen of the Summer Festival," coined.',

In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.\\nIf chatting with the guest is her way of \"understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted,\" then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how ___ rewards herself.

After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.\\nHer neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things.

Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask ___ to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life.

With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.\\nMany people have come to ask ___ for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship.

Even I can't possibly do it all,\" she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks.

As long as she found them "sufficiently shiny," whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.\\nIndeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.\\nBut it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that "rainbows" could indeed be exchanged for "fireworks."\\nThough some might take it for naivete, ___ will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.\\n"The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures."\\nThe legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...\\nPerhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to ___.\\nThe children gather around ___, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma\'s lockdown.\\n___\'s own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.',
