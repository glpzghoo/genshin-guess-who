From as far back as he can remember, he was already adventuring deep within domains with his master.\\nOf course, Miss Alice, the Knights of Favonius, and that traveler who had a sense of the stellar depths about them...

And yet his master is unquestionably the most special to him.\\nFor Albedo, she is his only kin.\\nShe was a cold and strict woman who raised him and taught him the secrets of alchemy.\\n"The universe is the sable essence of the true starry sky... Earth is the accumulated memory of time and being...\\nChalk: that is you. Soil is where alchemy derives its name, and is the basis of all life. And this..."\\nShe demonstrated her technique before him as a huge life form burst from its culture tank in a shower of shattered fragments.\\n"...This is new birth."',

      text: 'Albedo once led a simple and content existence.\\nThere was no need for him to contemplate anything. Life was uneventful, its meaning consisted of nothing more than accompanying his teacher, doing what she asked of him, and meeting her expectations.\\nBut one day, deep in the heart of a dungeon, master and apprentice discovered an artifact known as The Heart of Naberius.\\nAnd with that, his master disappeared, leaving naught but a note, a recommendation letter, and a classical text behind.\\nUpon the note was written: "Albedo, go to Mondstadt. Find my old friend, Alice, and give her the recommendation letter. Then, complete your final assignment."\\nThe classical text was one of the last extant manuscripts of the Opus Magnum from his master\'s collection.\\nIf one were to push the definition a little, she had left him another gift — the title of Kreideprinz, and with it, a written acknowledgment that she had nothing further to teach him.\\nIn the past, Albedo\'s assignments had always been very difficult.\\nHe had always believed wholeheartedly that his master would make good on her threat to leave him, should he fail.\\nBut this assignment she had left to him was far too hard, far beyond the limit of his abilities.\\nDid this mean, then, that he was fated to never complete it, and thus never see his master again?\\n"Your final assignment: show me the truth and the meaning of this world."',

As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.\\nThis art of creation was known as "The Art of Khemia."\\nAlbedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master\'s notes.\\n The next stage after "soil" is "chalk," which was also something his master had mentioned.\\n"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man."\\nNow, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.\\n"From soil was birthed chalk."\\nThe profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.\\nSuch ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.\\nShe was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.\\n"I hope this isn\'t just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about \'the meaning of this world\'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?"\\nFrom time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.',

      text: 'Albedo\'s interest in drawing and painting began back in the days of traveling with his master.\\nAt first, he would simply illustrate his notes with basic sketches. But he soon noticed that the process of rendering things in great detail helped him to intimately understand their physical makeup, which was of great utility to his alchemical studies.\\nAdditionally, it also allowed him to enter into a pleasant state of clarity, in which he needed only to focus on observation and creating his artwork, and nothing else.\\nEventually, Albedo became a master artist without ever having received formal tuition.\\nWhen strolling through Mondstadt, he enjoys sketching and painting all manner of living things, but particularly people in moments of joy.\\nSometimes, he even gifts his artwork to his unsuspecting models, believing that when a work of art captures a transient moment of enjoyment, it is something worth treasuring.\\nAlbedo continued to refine his skills in this manner, going from strength to strength — until one day, when he was taken aback by illustrations from Inazuma.\\nHow was it that drawings of such generality could possess such narrative power?\\nAmazed, he decided to give it a go himself.\\n...Eventually, after collaborating with a certain novelist by the name of Xingqiu, "A Legend of Sword" was printed and published.\\nUnfortunately, it received lukewarm reviews, being lambasted as "a dictionary with divine illustrations."',
