As their youngest member, Rosaria was judged to have a chance of rehabilitation.\\nGrand Master Varka brought her to Mondstadt. Sincerely hoping that she might someday fit in here, he advised her:\\n\"Go to the Cathedral and be cleansed by the light of our archon. You still have the chance to turn your fate around and live a normal life.\"\\nBut Varka had not counted on Rosaria constantly skipping classes and dodging hymnal.\\nShe would rather hunt in the wild than settle into a life of dutiful service as a sister. As far as she was concerned, the golden sunlight was not so much cleansing as blinding.\\nFor Rosaria had long since come to understand that she was a child of the moonlight, and it was inevitable that she would someday return to the embrace of darkness.",

What\'s more, it was true â€” she had indeed found other work for herself, and much darker work at that.\\nThe unexpected twist was that she would ultimately end up doing this work under the aegis of the Church.\\nRosaria the novice did not leave the clergy, but instead became Sister Rosaria without much incident.\\nNevertheless, when she\'s not on a mission, she does everything she can to avoid attending church activities, instead heading to the taverns to drink or scaling the city walls to view the scenery.\\nAnd when she simply cannot escape a church engagement, you can be sure that she will be the first to leave.\\nThe instant the workday is done, Rosaria vanishes.\\nWhether by bright day or dark night, there is one principle that she will never transgress: no overtime.',
