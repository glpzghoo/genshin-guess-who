These three great clans are known throughout Inazuma.\\nKamisato Ayaka is the young lady of the Yashiro Commission\'s Kamisato Clan, known far and wide as the Shirasagi Himegimi.\\nWhen asked the whys and wherefores of such a nickname, many Inazumans have their own explanations...\\n"Lady Ayaka is as graceful and pure as an egret. And just look at her elegance, her clever yet proper speech — why should she not be named a Princess?"\\n"Lady Ayaka may be of noble birth, but she is gentle and polite to us. She is kind, loyal, and is willing to help others. She even went against the opinions of others and took in that commoner, Thoma."\\nThere are as many opinions concerning this as there are people, but none can say where the "Shirasagi Himegimi" nickname actually originated.\\nStill, Ayaka\'s popularity amongst the people is quite plain to see.',

As such, the two siblings came to an accord.\\nThe elder brother, Ayato, preferring not to show his face too often, would busy himself with government affairs, while the act of maintaining the clan's image would be the responsibility of the elegant, socially-adroit younger sister, Ayaka.\\nThrough her dignified, demure, and polite posture, Ayaka has very much secured a place for herself in the social arena. Whether she is negotiating with potential partners or dealing with difficult nobles, her actions are all well-founded and beyond reproach.\\nThe internal clan affairs are also in her care.

Not wishing to trouble the old lady, Ayaka replied that she was a nearby resident who had gotten lost and entered this place.\\nAs a member of the Yashiro Commission, Ayaka was well-acquainted with the people\'s lives and quickly recognized this solitary old lady as the very same person who busked in the city streets when the weather was good.\\nThe tune was outdated, and so was the song. As one who could not see, this lady had long fallen out of step with the times. Even in the nation that pursues eternity, some still endured such hard lives.\\nOut of the goodness of her heart, Ayaka, thusly incognito, spent a long time chatting with the old lady. Taking Ayaka for an ordinary maiden, the old lady spoke of the method of making and playing the koto, and even gave her some tea leaves that she had kept stored up.\\nCompared to the exquisite leaves that the Kamisato Clan had in stock, these rough leaves may as well have been grass, but Ayaka accepted them while profusely thanking her.\\nThat day, she thought of her parents many times. Had they been around, would they not have grown this old someday?\\nReturning home, she spoke of her encounter with her brother, and the two siblings shared the rustic tea gifted to her by the old lady.\\nAfterward, Ayaka would come to see that old lady again every few days, each time posing as a person living nearby, and each time bringing with her some daily necessities that were well-loved by the common folk.\\n"The sakura trees in the streets have bloomed again," Ayaka said to the old lady with a smile, "and they are as lovely as your music."',

So for someone as noble as Kamisato Ayaka, surely she too must lead a life of wanton luxury.\\nThis statement is only half right, however.\\nAyaka does ostensibly live in a much more particular manner than the ordinary citizen.\\nThe costs of studying flower arrangement and tea ceremony, sampling fine teas, and enjoying exotic flowers daily are also by no means small. However, these are all skills that she must master as a young lady of a noble house — such commitments can hardly be called "wanton."\\nThe things that can truly make Ayaka smile are, in fact, ordinary things that even the common folk can enjoy.\\nThe making of snacks, fishing for goldfish by the ponds, squirreling herself away to read the latest novels from Yae Publishing House... Each one of these is but a tiny matter.\\nAt such times, she is not the adored Shirasagi Himegimi, or Lady Ayaka, mistress of the great Kamisato estates. She is just "Ayaka," an ordinary girl like any other.\\nHere, she sets her dignified externalized persona aside and sets her true, casual self free. Only as "Ayaka" can she lay down her heavy burdens and do the things that ordinary girls can do.\\nWhen hungry at night, she sneaks past the servants into the kitchen and makes herself some chazuke while humming a little tune. During tea ceremony classes, she might surreptitiously try to use the tea leaves to indulge in some romance-related astrology... The list of her little escapades goes on.\\nThough she has never told anyone this, Ayaka treasures her time as an ordinary girl above all else, for these moments of freedom are things she rarely ever has.',

To be able to teach such a pupil is a teacher\'s pride and joy.\\nStill, Ayaka thinks quietly to herself, does she truly have no regrets?\\nThe essence of tea is peace and quiet.\\nThe heart of the sword is the keenest edge.\\nThe soul of chess is the wisdom to grasp the bigger picture.\\nThese three she has grasped indeed, and the spirit of true friendship also.\\nAnd yet, Ayaka is still waiting for a friend to emerge who can walk alongside her on equal footing and stand by her side.\\nThat person cannot see her as a member of the Yashiro Commission, or as the Shirasagi Himegimi, nor will their conduct towards her be bound by decorum or status. And if possible, they might also be well-versed in a great many fields of study, and have witnessed all manner of interesting things... and perhaps they might even be able to tell her a story in a pinch.\\nOnly such a person might become Ayaka\'s bosom friend.\\n"Surely, this is not too much to ask...

At that time, Ayaka was not yet the mature and capable person she is now.\\nShe was originally a playful child, one who knew nothing of the clan\'s duties, and thus lacked the skill and experience needed for dealing with various kinds of people altogether.\\nBut seeing her mother on her sickbed and her brother hard at work, Ayaka sensed that she too had to grow up.\\nSo she decided to take up her long-disused sword arts and poetry, both staples of nobility. If she could master these two, she could at least pass for a decent lady of the Kamisato Clan, and thus help her brother show up at some festivals, alleviating his burden.\\nTruth be told, Ayaka was not preternaturally gifted and would spend much time being troubled by her inability to memorize poetry, write elegantly, or brandish her sword.\\nYet she did not waver — a poem she failed to memorize once would be memorized fifty times, a poorly-written word would be written fifty times over, and a sword technique that failed would be swung fifty times more.\\n"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times." — This was something her mother told her.\\nWhen her mother left this world, Ayaka was no longer "Little Ayaka." She was now Kamisato Ayaka, the young lady of the Kamisato Clan, one of the Shogun\'s three great clans.\\nSword art training thus became part of her daily life and has remained so to this day without pause.\\nOn one particular day, Ayaka, at last, defeated an opponent in a single strike. In that instant, as she stood in the middle of the dojo, icy flowers condensed all about her. And there, upon the tip of her sword, now hung a Vision, icy and bright.\\n"None may deflect a swing that has been practiced a thousand times" indeed — and even the gods may thus be moved.',
