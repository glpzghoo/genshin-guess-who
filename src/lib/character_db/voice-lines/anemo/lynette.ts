As an assistant, she needs only misdirect the audience at opportune moments, ensuring the spotlight stays on the protagonist.\\nWhether on or offstage, ___ habitually hides behind Lyney, in shadows that neither lights nor compliments can penetrate.\\nFor an assistant, keeping a low profile is a professional matter.\\nAnd as for a child of the "House"... being cloaked in shadow is how one survives.',

One tends toward the light, absorbing the audience's attention.

Thus do many assistants, once their skills are fully developed, strike out on their own — they will not forever remain the pupil.\\nWhen Lyney became famous, many notables took notice of ___'s potential, believing that she could achieve greater stardom still should she become an independent act. Some even asked her to take up the role of a leading actress in their films.\\nCat ears on young lady, who was also a magician...

Only by blowing on it, puff by small puff of air at a time, may one achieve the ideal temperature, so as to neither scald nor be shorn of flavor.\\nAnd once this ideal temperature has been achieved, one should not also drink it all immediately.\\nSome teas have greater flavor as you near the bottom of the cup, and a wait of several minutes should be imposed after one mouthful before one may continue on and savor the next sip. That is why she always takes her time when drinking tea.\\nBy the time the teapot is empty, the conversation is usually also just about over.\\nAnd as for the teaware on the table...
