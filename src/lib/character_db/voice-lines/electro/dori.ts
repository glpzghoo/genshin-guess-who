At this time, their home came to be ringed by a great many strange adults.\\nThe strangers explained the elder sister\'s situation in serious tones and with unfathomable jargon before sighing at the dingy little room.\\nThe younger sister had no idea what was happening, but she visited her sister every day, and her sister would always say this to her with a bright smile:\\n"It\'s alright.
