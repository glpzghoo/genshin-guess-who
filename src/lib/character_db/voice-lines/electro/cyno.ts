Then, there was a researcher from Spantamad who had aimed to test a Ruin Guard's ability to cultivate fields, but lost control of the modified machine, resulting in the ruin of many farmlands and grave injuries for several farmers.

Yet, instead of letting them suffer the consequences, ___ will come to their rescue without hesitation, just so that he can bring them back to the Akademiya to face their proper punishment.\\nOnce, a criminal who had crossed the Great Red Sand with ___ asked him about the point of doing all this. ___ replied,\\n"Only the law can judge you, and my role here is to bring you to face the scales."\\nAfter being released from prison, the researcher, who had been a Vahumana graduate, turned their adventures returning to the Akademiya into a novel titled "The Goon," which remains a bestseller in the Akademiya. The researcher was even invited by Vahumana to give a lecture, during which they went into great detail about the portrayal of "justice" in the book.\\nIf you ask ___, however, he would say that certain parts of the book were heavily exaggerated. In truth, they did not encounter any monsters created by the descendants of King Deshret, nor did they stray into a living labyrinth at the bottom of the desert or survive a sandstorm in the folds of a humongous Wenut.\\nNevertheless, ___ did appreciate the candidness with which the author described their own crimes, and would like to remind them to not commit such crimes ever again.',

He can still well remember that the book he was reading that day mainly talked about the six cardinal sins that the sages had decided on, which they held to be the origins of all crimes and thus served as the foundation for all the modern rules and regulations of the Akademiya.

Then he went over several academic cases with Visions involved and ensured that this Vision was not some malicious trap. He went on to ponder the challenges he might encounter after becoming the General Mahamatra and how this Vision might help in these future trials... After carefully weighing up the pros and cons, ___ finally accepted this gift from the gods earnestly.\\nBy then, the morning light was already shining through the windows. ___ left the library with the Vision and his as-yet-unfinished read in hand before heading over to the location where he was to be inaugurated as the General Mahamatra.\\nIf all went well, in half an hour, he would become the Akademiya's new General Mahamatra.\\nHe was about to be entrusted with the sacred power to judge those who had erred, and this Vision would ensure that this sacred privilege could be exercised as intended.",
