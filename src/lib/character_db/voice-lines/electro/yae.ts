Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn\'t this the hot genre of the day?"\\nFaced with the editor\'s doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, "not free enough."\\nThings like "top sellers," "genre fiction," these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.\\nGetting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?\\n"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there\'s no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well."\\nUpon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.\\nThe latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed.\\n"Um... What do we do? This isn\'t good..."\\n"Exactly! I mean, there\'s \'not being concerned about genre, and then there\'s something like \'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden\'... This is just too much!"\\n"Hmm? Genre? No, no, there\'s no problem with that — it\'s his pen name I\'m worried about. It\'s too normal for a book like this."\\n"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you\'re happy, Lady Yae."\\nNot long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name "Kadenokouji Kenzaburou."\\nAs to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a "Reborn as Guuji Yae" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day.',
