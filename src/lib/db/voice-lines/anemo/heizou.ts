Yet, judging by that ever-present grin, you can hardly tell if he is actually there working.\\nFunnily enough, all his "unorthodox behaviors as a public servant" are somewhat acquiesced to.\\nHis colleagues are more than willing to work with him and his boss seldom criticizes him for being this unfettered.\\nEven his boss\'s boss inquires after him every now and then.\\nAll this can be safely chalked up to his unrivaled prowess as a detective.\\nWhenever the Tenryou Commission is tackling an unusually complicated case, be it a major one or a mysterious one, everyone regards ___ as their last hope to crack the code.\\nEven the head of the Police Station marvels at his extensive experience in solving cases, but ___ himself has a different opinion about that.\\n"Experience is another name for people\'s past mistakes, and that\'s not my trump card."\\n"My trump card is something I was born with."',

Not only do you have to pass the ability test, but also a thorough background check.\\nTherefore, candidates are usually required to declare some essential information, such as any valuable property.\\nAccording to Yoriki Owada, who was in charge of the check at the time, when ___ applied, he handed in nothing but a blank declaration form.\\nIt was a bright and sunny morning. Sitting opposite Owada, ___ was curiously exploring the place with his eyes. Owada, who had been around the block by then, spent a moment deciphering the blank form, then looked up and insinuated,\\n"I\'ve met many brilliant young people. However, it\'s a shame that none of them made it to the Station in the end."\\nHearing this, all of a sudden, that seemingly hyperactive young man stopped looking around, sat up straight, and looked Owada in the eye.\\n"Right. How about a young person like me?"\\nHis switching happened so fast that Yoriki Owada was suddenly stunned, feeling like prey in the sights of some hawk-eyed predator.\\nOut of nowhere, a strange sensation came over him, as if at that moment, he was the one being scrutinized.\\nHe said jokingly then, as though it would steady his nerves,\\n"The Tenryou Commission does not discriminate against the poor. But if you have literally nothing to declare, then we\'ll make sure we pay extra attention to your background."\\nIt was followed by an unexpected silence. The one sitting opposite looked straight at him without saying a word, just as before.\\nOwada wasn\'t feeling his best, his forehead slightly twitching. Maybe it was too hot. He made to wipe off the sweat with the back of his hand.\\nHowever, there was no sweat on his forehead at all. Owada stared blankly at the dry back of his hand, not knowing if he should wipe again or put his hand down.\\nThe young man burst out into laughter upon seeing this. His hearty laughter immediately relieved Owada from his overwhelmed state.\\n___ just leaned on the table with his chin in one hand, pointing to his head with the other. He smiled at Owada and said,\\n"Other than my genius, I have nothing to declare."',

Most detectives also hold this belief dear to their hearts.\\nBut ___ reckons there\'s more to it. That there might be something that\'s even more vital than the truth.\\nYears of experience working as a detective have made him aware that when a new case comes to him, that means something unfortunate has already happened.\\nNo matter how the criminals are punished for their evil conduct afterward, it cannot change the fact that someone has already been hurt.\\nSimilarly, no matter how skilled a doctor is, they will never be able to treat a patient and pretend that nothing ever happened, telling them,\\n"Look, all your wounds have healed, as if you were never wounded in the first place."\\nThe truth is from then on, whenever the patient sees a doctor, sees an infirmary, or sees the scars left by the operation, they will be reminded every time of all the wounds that were once on their body, hurting them.\\nDoctors are helpless to prevent violent actions from being executed somewhere. Detectives cannot stop new cases from emerging.

Once they submit to the darkness, I will hunt them down to the ends of the earth."\\nIt was at that point that he made his decision to leave the agency and join the Tenryou Commission.\\nIt was the starting point for him to become the "detective" he seeks to be.',

Uesugi, not comprehending what had happened, thought to himself that maybe he should really consider being a comedian.\\nAt that moment, ___ brushed his shoulder as if to remove the awkwardness along with the dust.\\n"I was just joking.

The only rule was that the one to knock their opponent from a fifty-pace ring would triumph.\\nTo everyone\'s shock, however, the "brainy" ___ would show up to this contest without using Vision, and he carried no weapon but his two bare fists, which in turn carried him to the final.\\nDuring that match, Kujou Sara, who had arrived upon hearing rumors of his prowess, assessed that the match was over even before it began.\\n"Doushin Shikanoin moves lightly and his fists are the match of any weapon.

Most of the people participating in the tournament were rather junior Doushin, and no one had expected that General Kujou herself would attend.\\n___ narrowed his eyes. He had originally only come to test his skills, such that he might not be found wanting in the extreme situations where his wits alone would not be sufficient.\\nBut at this moment, his blood was up and the spirit of competition had descended on him like it often does on youths, and so he gladly accepted. In a flash, the atmosphere heated up and everyone was flushed with excitement.\\n"Great going, ___!" Doushin Uesugi yelled from the stands, Yoriki Owada quietly pumping a fist from beside him.\\nAfter a moment\'s preparation, both parties entered the ring. The rules were slightly different this time: neither of them would use their Visions. This would only be a contest at fifty paces between Sara\'s arrow and ___\'s fists. Whoever touched the other first with their weapon would be declared the victor.\\nThe atmosphere by now was practically bursting at the seams. The battle was about to begin. Yet few realized that in a battle between experts, each move was peril itself, and that the match would be ended in a single shot.\\nSara let fly, and fifty paces away, ___ was seen with his right hand clenched in front of his chest, tightly gripping an arrow that quivered but two finger-widths from his heart like a striking serpent.\\n"It\'s my loss. What a frighteningly fast shot," ___ said with a laugh, before throwing the arrow aside. "There was no time to evade, General, so I was forced to touch your weapon."\\n"I won by dint of the rules alone. I have met very few who could catch one of my arrows barehanded.

"Sin." That was its name.\\nBut it was not his friend\'s sin of deception or theft, nor was it the murder that the thief committed. It was something more abstract, something of a higher order.\\nIt was the culmination of all the sins in this world, hovering over all like a titanic shadow covering the skies, fixing its cold and unfeeling gaze on all that was good in this world, and seeking ways to snuff it out.\\nOne morning, one month later, ___ sneaked out of doors to travel afar, leaving a farewell note behind. He had found his enemy, and he would now embark on a journey to make war against it.\\nAccompanying him on this journey was a green stone, but it was not the pebble that symbolized friendship, but instead a Vision that stood for his resolve.',
