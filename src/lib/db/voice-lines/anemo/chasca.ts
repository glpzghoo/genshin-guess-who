She had no wings she could spread to fly, so she would leap amongst the treetops. She was not born with beak and claw, so she would arm herself with stones in their place.\\nAll too eager to attempt a hunt of her own, she wandered the woods until at last, her first mighty foe came forth — a foraging Forest Boar.\\nImitating the Qucusaurs\' movements, she leaped at the boar, only to be sent spinning to the ground by its fierce charge.\\nRolling to her feet, she snatched up a nearby rock and hurled it, only for the boar to dodge.\\nUltimately, she was forced to return empty-handed, her whole body ragged, covered head to toe in injuries and abrasions.\\nHer mother brought herbs to treat her, and her sister vigorously opposed any future forays.\\n___ agreed to stay and heal in the nest, but dove into the mountains the instant her wounds closed.\\nShe shuttled between forest and stream, collecting all manner of odds and ends to use: Sharp-edged stones, sturdy sticks, sticky sap, the skins of dead animals...\\nHer family did not quite understand the purpose of all this "junk," but thought ___ having a new hobby was a good thing nonetheless.\\nThey never imagined she would use them to fashion a new weapon — a slingshot made from sticks and skin, all the better for shooting stones both faster and further.\\n...\\nThe Forest Boar had a little squirrel cornered, yet what it had not realized was that it too had entered another\'s hunting grounds.\\nWithout warning, it found something stuck to its hooves, and it struggled in vain to get free. Then, several sharp objects, whistling through the air, struck its skull one after another. With a cry, the boar fell into a dead faint on the spot.\\nOnly then did ___ emerge from the bush and excitedly drag her trophy back to the nest.\\nHer mother and sister thought then that ___ would surely become a skilled huntress — yet the way events were to unfold would far exceed their expectations once again.\\n___ contemplated and discovered ever more combat techniques, as if there was always some voice in the dark guiding her on, showing her more ways to fight.\\nBut the longer she followed this voice, the less willing she became to skulk in the shadows. She became obsessed with seizing the initiative, with matching herself against bird and beast alike.\\nBrown Deer, Flying Squirrels, Halberd-Crest Birds, each in their turn she would eagerly challenge. Rather than being a huntress skilled in the singular, fatal ambush, she was more akin to an unyielding warrior, one who sought battle and would find rest only in death.\\nBut the more addicted she became to the thrill of the fight, the less prey she would obtain — for animals tend to be the vigilant sort, and having recognized in her a formidable foe, they naturally choose to flee at the first chance.\\nYoung ___ thus faced a quandary: the intoxication of battle, or a full stomach...\\nAnd what an impossible choice that seemed to her then!',

I know I agreed to take an orphan in... but, you didn\'t say it was an orphaned Qucusaurus!"\\nGiven the frequency with which Natlan faces Abyssal invasions, it was not uncommon for war orphans to be adopted, but one like ___, abandoned by humans and adopted by Saurians... That was the stuff of legends, and legends alone.\\nAs events would prove, Cusco had in fact underestimated the destructive might of this "Qucusaurus." Qucusaurs were already well-known for doing things their own ways, but ___\'s temper would prove harder to restrain than even the proudest among that race of Saurians.\\n"That vulture! She\'s stolen meat from the warehouse — again!"\\n"My house isn\'t your damn nesting ground, you little vulture!"\\n"Damn.. the little vulture\'s started another fight!"\\nWorse still, Qucusaurs usually had some specific intention behind their actions. To obtain food perhaps, or to defend their territory... but little ___ seemed set on kicking up trouble for its own sake. She had food far more delicious than raw meat set before her at the table, and her bed was far softer than a roost of straw, but still she would constantly stir up conflict, day and night.\\nThis really had Cusco\'s brows all knitted up. He had realized that this might not be some simple wildness of temper, or an inability to adapt to her new circumstances... But what was the root of it?\\nHumans would die for money, and monsters for food, but this? This pursuit of conflict without gain, without negotiation, without anything but a desire for destruction? Only one other example sprung to mind — the Abyss.\\n...Perhaps it was time to have a good "talk" with his daughter.\\nAnd so, when ___ next got herself in hot water, only barely restrained by two elite members of the flying squad, Cusco hurried over to apologize once more for not watching over her carefully enough, then rubbed his forehead in exasperation and asked:\\n"...Now, what do you want? If you never speak up, no one will ever understand."\\n"The hell are you even asking her for, Cusco? This vulture can\'t even say a single damn word! Seriously, what were you and the Elder thinking..."\\nLittle ___ glared venomously at the flying squad members holding her down, a growl forming in her throat, before it warped into a single hoarse "word":\\n"V... Vultures!"\\n...Well, that was a start, Cusco thought with a wry smile. As far as communication went, a counter-insult still counted.',

This is an ominous sign, and something that we have never before seen."\\nThe shaman sighed, thinking for a moment, before speaking again, words weighty and considered.\\n"...Perhaps it might be best for all if we took this chance to return her to the forest now."\\nCusco could hear the implied meaning. Dealing with ___ was hard enough now, and she was still little now. Who knew what she might be like in the future?\\nThe Abyss was ever Natlan\'s nemesis, and to keep her in the tribe was to house a potential calamity.\\nBut unless they were to find some way to restrain the Abyss within... a "return to the mountains" was but a euphemism for "abandoning her to her fate."\\n___\'s desire for battle was inborn, just as all humans are born with a desire for food. Others fought for a reason, and once their objectives were achieved, there was no further need to push themselves further.\\nBut ___\'s yearning was as a bottomless hunger. Even the sweet taste of constant victory could only sate her for so long.\\nIf that craving could not be contained... then perhaps her fate would be to destroy all around her until nothing remained, or be slain in some fierce battle.\\n"You must make your decision... \'now.\'"\\nThe shaman\'s words leapt about in the darkness like the candle\'s flame.\\nCusco looked at little ___.

With her personality, there was no way she knew how much their parents worried for her... or how well they treated her.\\nChuychu had once imagined what life would be like if she had an elder sister — a playmate, a sharer of woes, someone to care for her when she fell ill...\\nBut since ___ had arrived, her father had become so busy, and her mother\'s free time had evaporated.

A moment later, someone raised their hand, and said with a trembling voice:\\n"We... It was just an argument at first! But then, someone said..."\\n"Someone said that Uncle Cusco and his whole family... were also idiots for... keeping this vulture in our tribe... We were just joking, I swear!
