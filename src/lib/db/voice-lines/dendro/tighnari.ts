If a less discerning eye were to appraise him, he might even look like some kind of small, rare animal native to the forests.\\nBut anyone who has ever been acquainted with him will know that there is clarity to his words and steadiness in his bearing.\\n"One moment, please. Judging from your equipment, you\'re a traveling merchant bound for Sumeru City, aren\'t you? Come back, please, you\'re going the wrong way."\\n"I mean, just look over there. The leaves are dense and the air grows damper. That doesn\'t seem like the main road leading to the city, no matter how you slice it."\\n"Oh dear, your waterskin is empty, isn\'t it?"\\n"Come, let me share some with you. Being in a rainforest is no reason to skimp on your water supply."\\n"If you drink any old water you find out here, you might next find yourself at Bimarstan, you know?"\\n"Of course, if that is part of your itinerary, then I suppose you have... interesting opinions."\\nAmidst the flurry of instructions, the lost lamb will have all the arrangements made for them before they know it.\\n"Um... Thank you so much! Still, uh, might I ask who you are...?"\\nAs the other Forest Rangers look upon the traveling merchant bowing to the diminutive Forest Watcher, they cannot help but laugh.\\n"Pfft-haha! Ahem. This is our G— Well, Forest Watcher ___."',

It should be passionately embraced by those who are curious about it as opposed to becoming a tool for survival, doled out in limited amounts.\\nUnfortunately, as a young researcher, ___ did not have anywhere near the clout to stand against the Akademiya, and even now he can only do what he can in a limited capacity.\\nAt the same time, reality does not quite match up to one's ideals—\\nAs such, some unlucky soul getting lectured by ___ is no uncommon sight in Avidya Forest.",

      text: 'There was a time when a certain vibrantly-colored flower was all the rage amongst the people of Sumeru. Many people would buy it to adorn their houses, and thus it gradually became a trend.\\nUnfortunately, this flower was not long for the world if removed from the rainforest, and would only last two days at best if so plucked.\\nFlowers that were no longer fresh would soon be discarded, left by the wayside to rot — a shame by any standard of imagination.\\nThis could not go on. Never mind the garbage or pollution-related issues, this trend ran the risk of damaging the forest ecosystem if it persisted long enough.\\nHowever, just as the Forest Rangers were mulling over this problem, ___ would send out an offer of cooperation with the flower sellers in the city:\\nThe Forest Rangers would help them gather fresh flowers for free, but that they should provide an additional service, informing those who came to purchase the flowers that if they sent them back by the second day, they would obtain a receipt that could then be exchanged within the next 3 days for a dried flower decoration.\\nThese decorations were of course provided by ___ and the Forest Rangers. The option to pay for them and how much to pay would be left up to the buyer of the flowers, just as things might go at a charity bazaar.\\nPart of this Mora would go to the store owner as service charge for collecting the leftover flowers, and the rest would be used for funding the Forest Rangers\' efforts to maintain the rainforest.\\nThis cooperation went quite smoothly indeed. The flower shop owners saved themselves the trouble of searching deep within the rainforest for their floral quarry and got some extra income; the Forest Rangers got to control the process and amount of flowers gathered, and also got some extra funds; those who bought flowers would not only receive a temporary flower as a companion, but also a more permanent memento.\\nThis all went quite swimmingly, but some rangers did not understand, asking: "Why didn\'t we just ban the gathering of such flowers in the first place? Wouldn\'t that have been simpler?"\\n___ shook his head when he heard this answer, causing his ears to shake.\\n"We shouldn\'t make such simple calculations. If we were to force our requests through, we would be just like a stolid lecturer who fails to have others understand, but who stirs up feelings of rebellion instead."\\n"If that were to happen, our reputation would be the least of our woes — we would have our hands full trying to deal with those who were coming to pick flowers illegally!"\\n"In any case, trends will change. Don\'t worry. I\'m sure the people\'s attention will shift to something else soon."\\nPragmatic as these words were, they quickly found traction with the Forest Rangers. Collei\'s nods were particularly rapid.\\n"The dried flower decorations that Master taught us to make have been pretty popular with the children, too!"',

Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both canines, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.\\nAs for the latter, though ___ is loath to admit it, it probably had something to do with what his father said then as he tousled his hair.\\n"This lad\'s fur is an intensely dark shade of green.
