Despite her departure long ago, her name is still praised in the stories told in every household in Sumeru.\\nOn the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol — one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.\\nBut the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.\\nFrom the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.\\nThe Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.\\nThrough the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that \"The God of Wisdom will never come back.\"\\nShe knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.\\nThus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, ___ makes no argument against it.",

Only through that can she enrich her experience, honing her skills to become powerful enough to face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world.\\nThere is no escape from this, her inexorable duty.\\nEven though very few feel unsatisfied with the status quo, ___ still remains steadfast.
