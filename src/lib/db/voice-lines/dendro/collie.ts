      text: 'If words are the vehicles of wisdom, being literate is undoubtedly the starting point of the pursuit of knowledge. ___, however, seems to have only barely reached the foot of the mountain of knowledge.\\nWhen she first arrived in Gandharva Ville, even the outspoken Tighnari showed obvious hesitation, making repeated inquiries with the General Mahamatra if she had walked through the wrong door, since he had yet to make any plans to teach preschool level courses.\\nStill, after several twists and turns, ___ did finally become a trainee. To facilitate her learning of words, Tighnari gathered a wide assortment of books and documents, in the hope that ___ would soon master enough words through extensive reading.\\nApart from the literacy encyclopedias for children and the mandatory-reading academic papers that made her head swell, ___ can most often be found reading fairy tale picture books from Mondstadt.\\nThe logic is simple: those books tend to have fewer words and more pictures. Even if you do not know the words, chances are that you can still guess their meaning by looking at the illustrations.\\nHowever, reading only children\'s books hardly sufficed to keep up with her curriculum. Once she had picked up slightly more words, she immediately started to look for new extracurricular reading materials.\\nAccording to some travelers who had passed through Avidya Forest, there was a type of book in Inazuma known as the "light novel," which was easier to read than academic papers, and with fewer illustrations than picture books. To ___, that sounded like the exact type of book she needed.\\nMore importantly, the plots of these "light novels" were often so incredibly riveting that as soon as they got a copy, many readers just had to finish reading it in one go, even if they had to stay up all night.\\nThat definitely sounded tempting to ___, since she had to force herself, more often than not, to stay awake long enough to finish her readings.\\nOne day after her forest patrol, ___ excitedly ran back to her dormitory with the newest volume of "Onibudou." She was so ready to pull an all-nighter reading the light novel — and as it turned out, she indeed stayed awake that night.\\n"My sealed power!" "The lonesome avenger!" "You\'d be wise to stay away from me!" "I shall never witness the grace of the gods!"...\\n—Covering her head with the quilt, ___ tossed and turned upon her mattress the entire night. Even as the dawn broke, she had not yet torn her mind away from these words.',

In the examination that had just concluded, ___ had hit the barrier between reality and expectations once more.\\n"Ugh... How am I supposed to tell Amber about this..."\\nPlus, she would have to ask her master to write the letter for her. Things like doing poorly on the test and wanting to have someone to talk to were not things she could easily speak out in front of her master, either.\\nIt just so happened that a tree hollow, roughly the size of a person, appeared along her patrol route, as if some god had overheard her mumblings.\\n"Wait, wait... Talking to Aranara about my problems... I mean, I\'ve read about it in the books, but they were children\'s books! I\'m sure I\'ve outgrown that... But now that there\'s no one around..."\\nBefore she knew it, she was already crouching in said hollow.\\nThe darkness turned into a solid fortress, isolating ___ from all kinds of pressure.\\n___, being an introvert by nature, found it difficult to present herself impeccably. No matter how hard she strove to be as outgoing and sunny as Amber, she could never manage to ignore her weariness and loneliness.\\nThus did ___ vent her distress to that hollow, emptying herself of all the negativity she had accumulated after getting back to Sumeru.\\n"Did ___ go on patrol in that area again?"\\nA few days later, Tighnari checked on ___\'s recent forest patrol routes, which she had been taking all too frequently, before looking at her test papers, which featured remarkably higher scores. He could not help but think to himself:\\n"Did she find a way to improve her grades in the forest? Well, that\'s not bad either way. Alright, I\'ll save that patrol route for her and leave her be for the time being. I\'ll have other Rangers take the other routes."',

She may not be as literate as her peers, which hinders her performance in all the written tests. Yet, she is nothing if not practical and creative.\\nWrapping thorny vines around her boots to increase traction, rubbing the toxic sap of poisonous mushrooms onto hunting traps to promote efficiency...\\nSuch ideas have ensured that she can travel in and out of the jungle safely, successfully extracting those unfortunate enough to become lost in the woods, accidentally ingest poison, or get hit by a running beast.\\nThose who have been rescued by ___ are, one and all, amazed by her unique but reliable survival skills — not to mention how they are all moved by her genuine kindness and enthusiasm.\\nBe it surrounded by grave dangers, or lacking food and supplies, even if the rescued traveler turns hysterical, she embraces every circumstance with the warmth of the sun.\\nShe cares little for scars, and hunger concerns her not. She just wants to offer help to whoever is in need.\\nThe only thing about her that is considered unacceptable by many is the recipes she utilizes during times of crisis: as long as they can replenish her energy, she will even gladly swallow fireflies without hesitation — the crushed pits of Zaytun Peaches are even less of an obstacle.\\nWhen people meet her, they simply cannot help but wonder about this young trainee\'s past.\\n—What sort of experiences could make such a seemingly innocent girl see the wilderness as her home?',
