Grand Master Varka had nothing but the highest praise for her, even declaring once that she was the Dandelion Knight's equal on the battlefield.\\nOn the face of it, to have two such outstanding knights attending to the defense of Mondstadt in a single generation should be a cause for nothing but celebration. But dig a little deeper and there is a fundamental difference between Jean and ___.\\nFor ___ is a descendant of the once-aristocratic Lawrence Clan. The blood that flows through her veins once flowed through those of Mondstadt's oppressors during one of the darkest periods of the city's history.\\nConsequently, ___ has been viewed with contempt by the citizens of Mondstadt since birth. The Lawrence name stands for a legacy of depravity and despotism that stains Mondstadt's past and scars the minds of its citizens even to this day.\\nSo, whenever ___ appears, old wounds resurface. People despise the aristocracy, and this does no favors for her reputation.\\nHowever, ___ is strong-willed and in spite of everything, she joined the Knights of Favonius and rose to the rank of Captain.\\nWhen people in the city voiced their reservations, she would respond head-on, claiming that her chosen course of action was out of a desire for \"vengeance.\" This matter-of-fact confession would alarm them all the more and has convinced everyone that she joined the Knights of Favonius only to serve as a mole for the former aristocracy.\\nOne person who sees things differently is Acting Grand Master Jean. In fact, she speaks rather fondly of ___.\\n\"The rumors are all groundless. The Spindrift Knight is simply misunderstood, that's all.\"",

In the eyes of the citizens of Mondstadt, the Reconnaissance Captain is as unpredictable and tumultuous as the waves on a stormy sea.\\n___ responds with a cold haughtiness to accusations of this nature. To any who dare insinuate such things to her face, she replies, \"How dare you. Hmph, I will remember this.\"\\nShe is consumed by the desire to avenge herself, but is often on the move far away from the city. Sometimes upon her return to Mondstadt, she will brandish her greatsword and march straight to the Knights of Favonius headquarters.\\nOn one occasion, two fresh recruits standing guard on their first day on patrol watched just such a scene play out before their eyes. Alarmed and unsure how to respond, they ultimately did not dare to intervene. Instead, they simply watched on helplessly while ___ made a beeline for Master Jean's office.\\nMuch to their surprise, however, hours passed and no sound of a struggle was heard from within.\\nStill worried, the guards raised their concerns to Cavalry Captain Kaeya and Librarian Lisa as they were passing by.\\n\"The Reconnaissance Captain is back again? When you saw her, was she marching towards Jean's office with her sword in hand, looking like she wanted to settle a score?\"\\n\"Goodness, I must head there straight away. How can they have a tea break without me?\"\\nLisa hurried to Jean's office the moment she finished speaking. Meanwhile, Kaeya took the two guards outside and explained to them whilst trying to suppress a fit of the giggles:\\n\"We all know that the Acting Grand Master is a good judge of character, don't we? The Knights of Favonius are interested in a person's ability, not their family history. That's why she gives up her time to spar with the Reconnaissance Captain. In doing so, she can preserve the dignity of the Knights of Favonius while also providing a way of settling old grievances. Quite brilliant, don't you think?\"\\n\"Ohh... Sâ€”So that's how it is...\" \"...So 'tea break' is code for 'sparring'...?\"\\nThis kind of thing occurs almost on a monthly basis. But... if they're engaged in some sort of strange sparring ritual in there for the sake of settling old grievances and honing their fighting skills... How come they don't make a ton of noise?",

On the contrary, constantly being met with prejudice at every turn means she is often the victim.\\nAt one time, shops would refuse to sell her their goods, restaurants would put no care and attention into her orders, and the citizens on her patrol route would refuse to cooperate with her. So, ___\'s work is fraught with difficulties.\\nWhen conflict arises, ___ fights back with a sternly worded threat to indicate that she will remember this grievance and make the offending party pay for it one day. It seems to work like a magic spell, because as soon as these words are uttered, the conflict ceases immediately without ever having to escalate to the level of an all-out confrontation.\\nFunnily enough, although people always have their guard up around ___, she is a law-abiding citizen and has never harmed another Mondstadter in her life. She may come across as having a somewhat frosty demeanor, but she is entirely scrupulous in her speech and conduct.\\nNo one can ever find fault with her actions, and as people gradually get to know her, their morbid fear of her will dissipate. They will also start to realize her threats of vengeance are nothing more than a figure of speech that simply serve as a verbal warning in the moment.\\n___, who may or may not be working to bring down the Knights of Favonius from the inside... ___, who may or may not be an aristocrat mole... New recruits in the Knights of Favonius find her the most difficult person to deal with.\\nWhen Jean sends a new recruit to track down ___ in the wilds and deliver a new set of verbal orders, they always receive the same response: "If you have to resort to tasking the descendant of your former oppressors with doing your work, then perhaps you are not as strong as I thought."\\nBut despite the antagonism in her words, she will complete her newly assigned tasks to perfection. The new recruit is invariably forced to admit that with her abilities, it is no wonder she was able to achieve a captaincy within just a few years of joining the Knights.\\nEveryone knows ___ as the frosty and antagonistic Spindrift Knight, the aristocrat who has a score to settle with the Knights of Favonius, an openly hostile and potentially dangerous individual... but is this really the truth of who she is?\\nOn the way back, the new recruit thinks back over ___\'s every action.\\n"What was that kind and resilient look I saw in her eyes when she wasn\'t looking at me?

If they're in an especially good mood, they may even exchange a few words with her during the process. It is at moments like this that ___ shows her most agreeable side.\\nBecause of this, and because Amber is just so nice, she'll often accompany ___ on trips out, or even run all her errands for her and deliver the goods straight to her home.\\nAmber is also the reason that the city folk end up hearing all about the Reconnaissance Captain's accomplishments out in the field. Each time Amber informs them of ___'s long list of achievements in battle, they can't help but let out a little gasp of surprise.\\nEarly one weekend morning, Amber stood atop a makeshift stage of wooden crates and began announcing ___'s latest highlights: \"Recently, the Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Captain saved the life of a woman at Dornman Port. After further investigation with this woman's close cooperation, she then proceeded to successfully capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port.

One staple of their inventory is a moon-shaped pie. Though a field ration, this wonderfully delicious and highly portable food is loved by all who try it.\\nThe Reconnaissance Company\'s designated chef once admitted that when developing this item, she was inspired by the captain\'s own baked goods. She extended the baking time to make the crust tougher and also substituted a few highly perishable ingredients with ones that last longer, reducing the cost while significantly prolonging the shelf life.\\nEven after such a major change to the recipe, the pie still tasted delicious. So, whenever the scouts are snacking, they can\'t help but wonder: If this is the field ration version, how delicious must the captain\'s original recipe taste?\\nThe answer to this question is buried deep within the pages of a dusty old book in the library. The Lawrence Clan may have been overthrown a long time ago, but they have never given up hope of one day rising again and reclaiming their place as the ruling class. So that they are always prepared for this monumental moment, their offspring are subjected to an educational regime so unbelievably harsh that it is considered borderline abusive.\\n"Noble obligations" must be performed to absolute perfection in every possible sense, and these obligations cover etiquette, ritual, and study as well as cooking and other domestic chores.\\nIn the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, "Post-liberation Mondstadt lacks etiquette and taste. When the day comes for our clan to seize power once more, there shall be none who are qualified to be our servants. We must be cautious. We must never stoop to the level of the commoners and set foot in the quagmire of vulgarity."\\nThe Lawrence Clan\'s culinary arts teacher was particularly strict. If your dough was missing a half-spoonful of flour, or if your condiment was a few grains of salt short, or if you were two seconds late removing something from the oven, you were likely to be both scolded and disciplined. As far as ___ is concerned, the haute cuisine revered by the aristocrats is just another worthless consequence of people dogmatically following outdated rules.\\nFor this reason, the only kind of person who ___ will permit to try her own home baking is someone who she... respects...? No, that would be taking it too far. Rather, it should be someone who she grudgingly accepts "will keep following me around and bothering me, seemingly undeterred by my warnings, despite having crossed me many times to date."',

The most important part of the Dance of Sacrifice, it was performed by the most senior dancer, who was typically the eldest daughter of the clan.\\nThe Lawrence Clan would summon top dancers to serve as tutors for the eldest daughter and ensure it was performed to perfection. Bleeding toes were seen as a point of pride and a rite of passage for every dancer.\\nThis ancient ceremony was a continuous tradition for so long that even today, long after being expelled by the people of Mondstadt, the Lawrence Clan still honors it.\\nHowever, without the grand banquet and the gorgeous stage that once featured prominently in ceremonial performances, the Dance of Sacrifice is now far from the grandiose affair it once was. Furthermore, the stringent requirements regarding the dancer\'s posture and movements have also been relaxed due to the lack of tutors. In the end, the Lawrence Clan reluctantly decided that it could no longer be a mandatory part of the curriculum, and they relegated it to an artistic pastime.\\nOver time, the negative connotations and elitist expectations associated with this dance have faded away, and today it survives simply as a graceful dance.\\nAs the eldest daughter of the present-day Lawrence Clan, ___ found it to be a relaxing pastime in her youth and a welcome respite from her other grueling courses of study.\\nToday, ___ appears to have put her artistic pursuits behind her. At least, no one pictures dancing when they think of the Spindrift Knight.\\nNevertheless, a distinctly dance-like aesthetic can be observed in ___\'s bladework, along with an elegant rhythm and musicality that are difficult to capture in words.\\nAs her greatsword rises and falls and sways to and fro, her distinctive and graceful poise is like that of a dancer under the moonlight: faraway, immaculate, and sublime.',
