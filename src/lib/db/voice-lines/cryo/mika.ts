During that time, the responsibility of looking after little ___ landed in Huffman's hands.\\nHowever, Huffman had already made the Knights of Favonius his second home â€” he was preoccupied with work during the day and indulged in drinking with his friends night after night. With his own life lacking organization, how was he expected to take care of his little brother?\\nSo it was little ___ who learned to take care of both himself and his brother whenever he'd return home drunk at night.

Picturing his parents' wonderful adventures was ___'s favorite pastime.\\nBefore long, ___ developed a passion for reading maps, and even committed the terrain of many locations to memory.\\nUnfortunately, Huffman had to ruin the mood when he broke the bad news to ___: \"I'm afraid your efforts have been wasted on the map Mom and Dad left us. It's very outdated, and it wasn't very accurately drawn in the first place.\" But that was to be expected. After all, those who with the ability freely explore the wilderness would likely have all become adventurers with nothing but commissions and Mora on their minds.

Not to mention their limited income, which wouldn't allow them to afford bodyguards. Perhaps the time would come when the Knights of Favonius finally had sufficient budget to hire experts to deal with matters like these, but with Mondstadt as peaceful as one could hope for, no one knew for sure when something as trivial as cartography could be put on the schedule.

As it happens, Ella Musk, whom he had gotten acquainted with while studying at the library, happened to be looking for a guide for a language exchange trip to the secluded wilderness.\\nAnd that became ___\'s first real expedition. Though they did safely arrive at their destination, due to an error in Ella Musk\'s word choice, the pair ended up getting beaten by the hilichurls.\\n___ concluded that this setback was due to his lack of combat prowess. "I need to learn how to protect myself," he thought, "or I won\'t be able to guarantee the success of my expeditions to unfamiliar areas."\\nThereafter, ___ rode the momentum from his time spent learning in the library and began to learn fighting techniques from his brother. Luckily, ___ had a strong constitution and quickly grasped the basics.\\nIt happened that the Knights of Favonius had just drafted their plan for an expedition set to depart three years later. They were still looking to recruit a few more members to fill some positions, and "Front-Line Surveyor" was among the open spots.\\nThis role had strict prerequisites: those applying for the position should have some level of expertise in cartography, and due to potentially dangerous conditions, they would be leading the team from the front lines, making combat skills a must.\\nThis was ___\'s chance, but it all felt too much like a dream...\\n___ initially believed that he would be invited into the team as an external consultant, but the position of Front-Line Surveyor would no doubt make him a full-fledged member of the expedition â€” and one crucial to the entire team. He was daunted by the thought at first, afraid that he wasn\'t worthy of such an important role that according to him, "only the strongest would qualify for."\\nHis doubts were soon dispelled by his father and brother\'s encouragement, and he remembers their words to this day:\\n"You don\'t have to ask too much of yourself. Doing your best to help will be more than enough."\\n"Most of the knights are just ordinary people like us, but once we put our strengths together as a team, even the strongest of adventurers would struggle to prove our equal."\\nThus, ___ seized the opportunity and signed up for the position.\\nHe felt reassured that he would, at least, be dedicating his time to what he loved.',

The little kid who always takes care of that drunkard will be joining the Knights!\"\\nThe anxiety from unexpectedly becoming the center of attention made his breaths quicken as his heart pounded â€” ___ was afraid of failing the Knights' assessment and disgracing his father, ruining his brother's career, or worse, ruining the reputation of his family name.\\nConsidering that many members of the Schmidt family had already joined their ranks, the Knights of Favonius decided to raise the bar for entry and make the whole assessment process public in order to make the selection as fair as possible.\\nTaking real-life scenarios into consideration, lead examiner Kaeya came up with a series of challenges that strictly assessed the participants' abilities:\\nHiking up Dragonspine while wearing full armor and carrying a heavy load;\\nMapping out a monster-infested region without the aid of any reference material...\\nLuckily, ___ came well-prepared and gave it his all, eventually passing the most difficult challenge and becoming one of three successful candidates.\\nThe other two candidates had both received ___'s aid along the way as well â€” to him, they were more like future teammates than competitors, in any case.\\n___'s excellent exhibition of teamwork gained the recognition of Grand Master Varka, who allocated the two other new recruits to the Cavalry Company and Investigation Team, while personally taking ___ in to go with him on his expedition.\\nEvery week, Varka would teach ___ combat techniques and give him assorted \"homework\" to complete.\\n___ would later join the Reconnaissance Company. Communicating with its rather unusual Captain further strengthened his communication skills, which would help him greatly when working with the elite knights of the expedition team.\\nAfter joining the Knights, ___ honed his cartography skills while investigating dangerous locations as a Front-Line Surveyor while receiving pointers on how he might improve his other skills from Varka.\\nThe diligent young recruit quickly became a calm and reliable knight â€” though it seems as though he has yet to realize that himself.",

But after personally inviting ___ to spar, he concluded that ___'s current abilities were \"remarkable, but far from enough.\"\\n___ didn't figure out what that meant until the expedition team entered a dangerous restricted area, where he finally saw with his own eyes the monsters Grand Master Varka had used as a reference when judging his powers.\\nThose unnamable, wandering creatures could become a nightmare for any knight unfortunate enough to stray away from the team.\\nThe speed of their scouts in the vanguard determined how fast the whole expedition team proceeded, so during the days when the team was the busiest, ___ could only rest for half an hour a day.\\nIt was ___'s first time working under such high pressure, and he did so with great difficulty. Not to mention that apart from dangers of the unknown, the expedition team was under the watchful gaze of another party...\\nOne day, when ___ was getting ready to call it a night, he received a warning from another scout that the Knights had encountered enemies.\\nWhen ___ hurried on scene, Varka had already drawn up battle lines with his trusty subordinates.\\nIn the depths of the pitch-dark night, ___ could vaguely make out a line of soldiers, silently standing there as if they were lifeless war machines.\\nAnd right in the middle of the enemy formation was a dark, distinct silhouette. Even though torches lit the area, ___ could see nothing but their eerily dark blue eyes that seemed to glow with an uncanny aura.\\nAt his teammate's reminder, ___ learned of their identity â€” the Fatui Harbinger known as \"The Captain\" and his direct, elite subordinates.\\nAs it turned out, their vanguard had bumped into Fatui scouts and an altercation had ensued, resulting in both sides getting jumpy and continuously requesting reinforcements, eventually alerting their respective commanders.\\nThe scent of gunpowder was thick in the air, the sense of crisis turned ___'s limbs numb and cold.\\nHe couldn't help visualizing the confrontation escalating into an armed conflict, and what he should do if such a thing were to happen...\\nThe Harbinger, in particular â€” ___ knew that he would be utterly helpless to parry a single half-hearted swipe from this person.\\nHis jumbled thoughts and exhaustion made it difficult to breathe or focus.\\nVarka, however, seemed completely unfazed. He greeted the Harbinger from afar and walked towards him with his weapon in hand. The Captain, too, signaled his men to stand by as he began slowly stepping forward.\\nAs the tension between the two parties reached its peak, Varka and The Captain briefly conversed and seemed to reach an agreement.\\nThe dark silhouette raised his arm, and the ghostly shadows of the Fatui soldiers silently turned and departed with him.\\nThe Knights all heaved a sigh of relief, and some were even trembling with fear. But when Varka returned to the Knights' formation, he looked as relaxed as ever.\\n\"Well, that was a surprise! If it weren't for our unique circumstances, I would've loved to invite him for a duel!\"\\n\"And it's not like he's a stubborn fellow. He's well aware that engaging in battle in a strange and foreign land would've been disadvantageous for both of us.\"\\nIt was only then that ___ realized they had been on the precipice of war, and conflict had been avoided only because the Grand Master had been there to prevent it.\\nThe Captain's overpowering presence and the calmness with which Grand Master Varka handled the crisis both left a profound impression in ___'s mind.\\n___ reflected on this experience for a long time and concluded that although he had been improving in strength, he still had a long way to go when it came to dealing with situations like that.\\nThere was more to be done than just doing his best to help the team.

Besides, many matters regarding the expedition were considered highly confidential and should be treated with discretion.\\nKaeya, on the other hand, seemed to enjoy joking about the rumors.

Designed to facilitate the quick production and use of maps, each of its pages can be conveniently removed and replaced.\\nAn elaborate pattern is carved on to the back panel of the device. Channeling elemental power into the carving will activate the prism-shaped component outside said panel, which will in turn fire a \"wavebeam\" towards a fan-shaped target region.\\nThe distance between the device and the target region can then be accurately calculated using the time taken for the beam to bounce back. By increasing both the frequency and amplitude of the beam, the device will generate a sketch of a small area of terrain.\\nThis function can greatly improve the accuracy of a map, but regrettably, everything else â€” including the statistical information and calculations regarding the terrain in question â€” has to be computed in the user's mind.\\nOnly those with excellent spatial reasoning skills and an extensive knowledge of the target terrain are capable of making full use of this function.\\nThus, ___ became the only Front-Line Surveyor who could use the device without difficulty, and its overall usage rate is not very high.\\nThere had been other improved devices originally planned for distribution to other teams, but they have been put into storage, to be used as spare parts for ___'s device.\\nThe device is ___'s trustiest helper in his work and a symbol of honor for being the best surveyor, but ___ has never once mentioned its impressive features to others.\\nTo ___, that feels too much like bragging, not to mention that it could potentially give Albedo extra work... Troubling others is the last thing ___ ever wants, after all.",
