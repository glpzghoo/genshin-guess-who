That person\'s name is ___. The adepti have been with Liyue for millennia, but only a handful have ascended in the past three thousand years, which means that everything regarding the traditions now only exists in texts.

These blessings derived from the Geo element led the Geo Archon to gain the title of God of the Stove.\\nPeople from other lands tend to call him Morax, though the people of Liyue prefer to use the term Rex Lapis.\\nBut in the hearts of lovers of opera and children, Morax's on-stage aspect, the all-conquering defender of Liyue — the Warrior God — is the most fascinating.\\nThe delicacies that Rex Lapis discovered while lost in the streets, the plaques inscribed with his handwriting, a famous opera that he once starred in, playing the part of a warrior...

Only a refined and strict order can sustain vibrant commerce, which is itself the lifeblood of Liyue Harbor.\\nThus the Qixing punish violators of such laws unceasingly, not only to uphold the divine rulings of Morax but also to allow Liyue to maintain its vitality.\\nThrough the millennia, every generation of the Liyue Qixing commits to interpreting the law, including subtle amendments to plug loopholes found in the law. Any loopholes that remain undiscovered are seen by the merchants as "permissible if unaddressed," and they make killings off such holes until they are discovered and patched up by the Liyue Qixing.\\nAmid this game of cat-and-mouse, the book that collates such amendments has reached a whopping 279 pages thick.\\nThe person currently responsible for maintaining this book, the Tianquan Ningguang, is secretly (and humorously) referred to as the "Tailor of Liyue," in honor of her speed in patching these laws up, and for her sharpness of eye.\\nBut no matter how complicated or tangled mortal laws become, one of these stands above all others in the eyes of Rex Lapis.\\n"The one who reneges on their words shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock."',
