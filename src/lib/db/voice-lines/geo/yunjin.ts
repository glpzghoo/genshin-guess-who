      text: 'Many traditional Liyue Operas revolve around the theme of the adepti and Rex Lapis himself.\\nA prime example would be "The Divine Damsel of Devastation." People are full of wonderful fantasies about the adepti and would like to see the representation of their joy and anger on stage. Thus, stories portraying them make up the majority of the repertoire of Liyue Opera.\\nWhen ___ was young, she would find these stories engaging, but having exhausted every adeptal legend in her performing career, her take on theming gradually changed.\\nWhy not experiment with other themes? For instance... stories of our own, perhaps?\\nStories that tell of our earthly joys and sorrows, songs that sing of the hatreds and passions of humanity.\\nMaybe these stories of mere mortals may not make it as classics of Liyue Opera, but there will always be some people who remember them.\\nIn love our thoughts linger, in rage our hearts burn, and in obsession, our minds go astray. These emotions, good or bad, lift the veil that covers our feelings and souls.\\n___ is no adeptus. She can never put herself in the shoes of the adepti, yet she is endowed with the most accurate and sensitive grasp of human emotions.\\n"So, let me sing of human stories. May my brush be the brush of all hearts and my voice the voice of all souls."\\nThis is the unspoken wish that ___ has so far only kept to herself.',

      text: "Her ancestors used to work as weaponsmiths instead of opera performers.\\nLater, someone in the family who was tired of weapon forging grew an interest in the performing arts. By the time it came to ___'s generation, few of the Yuns still practiced the art of forging.\\nMany forged things have been passed down, though. The lock-shaped copper pendant that ___ carries with her is one such item.\\nIn her childhood, she often practiced dancing for a whole day under the scorching heat of the sun. Sometimes, she would even faint from the exhaustion.\\nHer parents' hearts ached for her, but they knew well that she had to go through such things to lay a solid foundation.\\nSo instead of stopping her, they gave ___ the lock in the hopes that it would keep fortune and health within her.\\nSince then, the lock has never left ___'s side. Before every performance, it is a routine for ___ to reminisce about those days of bittersweet training by cleaning the lock with great care.\\nIt feels as if she was caressing the devoted heart of the little ___ who was learning the opera.",

      text: 'Shortly after ___\'s debut, ___ quickly got the hang of stage performance through dozens of shows and her great intelligence.\\nAt the time, her appearance meant a whole night of applause for a performance. However, the more she played, the more she felt at a loss — these were not the operas she wanted to perform.\\nIn every opera, the pitch and tempo would invariably go either up or down to indicate drama or doldrum.\\nAs time passed by, the visage of the various characters seemed to blend and blur.\\nThe music would come on, followed by a neat dance, and then her sweet voice. The girl in "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" seemed no different from the fisherman\'s daughter in "String of Pearls."\\nWhile the audience did not object, ___ was not satisfied. "Is skillful singing and dancing all it takes to tell a moving tale?"\\nWhat broke her bottleneck was an opera named "Snow Treading."\\nIt was a monodrama about a strenuous walk in the snow. It happened to be a snowy day when ___ first performed the opera.\\nHaving gone astray in the snow, the character felt lost and lamented her helplessness. Somehow, the snow in the story seemed to fall into reality. ___, who had also found herself adrift, felt as if she had become her character.\\nThat was what she had been looking for, the feeling of leaving herself behind and walking in the shoes of the many characters she played.\\nTo breathe, to live, and to smile just like them.\\nThat was the opera she had wanted to sing, the story she had wanted to tell — one about true emotions, a world built on tens of thousands of individuals who live lives of their own.\\n___ could no longer recall how she returned backstage after the epiphany. All she knew was that when she finally had time to take off her costume, she found a Vision in her sleeve.',
