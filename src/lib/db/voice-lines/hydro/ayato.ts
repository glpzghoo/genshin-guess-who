People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.\\n___\'s great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.\\nFind some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.\\nAnd when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear — after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?\\nOver time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate.\\n"Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?"\\nSo people would often say.\\nHowever, while ___ is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.\\nFirstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others\' petty profit.\\nMostly, ___ will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling.\\n"Ah, come now, Sir Nagaoka. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I\'m sure we can resolve this issue together."',

However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.\\nPerhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the Yae Publishing House staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to "report for work." In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then "accidentally" let slip his newfound knowledge to Guuji Yae.\\nIn a meeting with those old fogeys at Tenshukaku, there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.\\nWhile walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he\'d ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he\'ll buy a few back for the rest of the household.\\nLately, he also lent some encouragement to the young oni who frequents Hanamizaka due to the latter\'s bug-fighting troubles — out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name "___" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.\\nOn the way home, he might pass Chinju Forest and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the bake-danuki, in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.\\nAnd of course, even one so talented as Thoma might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner.

That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.\\nBut such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, ___ could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.\\nNo matter how long she would go on, ___ would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.\\nWith the passing of years, ___\'s days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books.

Remember this well."\\nAs for the specifics of what happened, ___ had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders\' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae\'s intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.\\nThis was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.\\nAs such, ___ never snubbed his father\'s teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon\'s protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.\\nNo matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.\\nEven if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.\\nJust as his mother said back then—\\n"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.\\nSo, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter."',
