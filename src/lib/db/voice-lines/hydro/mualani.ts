Her goods are expertly designed and of superb quality, while she herself has a vast wealth of knowledge in her capacity as a guide.

      text: "There's a certain young lady who tends to leave a deep impression on anyone who's spent any length of time among the People of the Springs, be they resident or tourist.\\nFor example, let's say you're enjoying a peaceful sunbathing session by the sea, and you suddenly hear a \"Woohoooooo~~!\" in the distance that quickly gets closer as a young lady on a surfboard rides a wave all the way to the shore at high speeds, leaping onto the beach and kicking up a curtain of sand.\\nOr maybe you're watching a beach volleyball match, and a certain lithe young lady shouts encouragement to her teammates before springing straight up the next second, spiking the ball back towards the other side, your shout of excitement resonating with the waves.\\nAnd then there was that one time you were invited to join a gathering, and a bunch of guests meeting for the first time were talking quietly, and people still seemed kinda tense. Just then, she showed up, like a superstar taking the stage, and announced at the top of her lungs:\\n\"C'mon, why's it so quiet? Music's playing, that means it's time to boogie!\"\\nAnd with that, she leaped to the center of the dance floor, swaying her body in time to the music, while those around her, infected by her enthusiasm, joined in one after another...\\nYou attempted to ask around about who she was, and you instantly got a name without even having to try: ___.\\nAnd later, when you went to buy some watersports equipment, there in the shop, you saw that beaming face once more.\\nAt first, you were only planning on buying a surfboard, but you ended up learning all about the different locations of the various hot springs of the People of the Springs and how the experiences they offer differ, important tips and tricks for surfing, as well as where to find her little Koholasaurus friends. Of course, she also recommended that you buy a blue board, since it'll bring you good luck.\\n\"Actually, I've seen you before...\" You attempt to bring up all the times you met before.\\n\"Oh wow, I didn't realize you were an old friend! In that case, I'll give you 40% off this time, and be sure to come find me if you want some surfing lessons!\"\\nYou originally intended to just kick back and relax for a few days, but ended up staying for several months. Over time, you two did in fact end up becoming good friends. One day, your curiosity gets the better of you and you finally ask her why she is so enthusiastic towards every single one of her friends, and even some strangers.\\n\"Yeah, I'd say... There are two kinds of people in the world. Friends you already know, and friends you haven't met yet.\"\\n___ thinks about it for a moment, then gives you a big smile.",

Not only have they established a trade network that spanned Natlan, but they have even established partnerships with foreign merchants.\\nWhen she was little, her parents were always busy cultivating relationships with their business contacts, and sometimes, they'd be running around outside the home for weeks at a time. So, ___ would often roam around town with their puppy, or spend her time with the other kids in the tribe, trying their hand at all kinds of watersports.\\nIt was only on holidays that the family would always decorate their house and make a big meal to celebrate.\\nDuring one such family dinner, ___ asked if she could help lighten their load and shoulder a bit of their work. That way, they should have more quality time together as a family.\\n\"Lots of adults say I've got an ideal personality for doing business!\" said she.\\nHer mother thought ___ ought to try doing many different things, experience different places, and then decide what she really wanted to do.\\nHer father added that it wouldn't be too late for her to join the family business if she still wanted to be a merchant afterward, but that they would support her completely should anything else capture her interest.\\nIn the end, ___ did travel all over, flitting freely over every peak and valley of Natlan like a bird. Many of those faraway vistas were truly enchanting, but as a seabird whose home was by the coast, she often missed the salty smell of the seabreeze.\\nAnd so she returned home and engaged in all kinds of watersports, researching the equipment used in them. She wasn't satisfied with the completed products available, so she began learning how to manually modify their functionality herself. She would also apply some lucky colors and some patterns, giving the products a dash more personality.\\nShe became the trendsetter, and every time she changed her gear, everyone else would fall all over themselves to get identical items. ___ was more than happy to indulge their requests, and over time, she became an \"equipment seller\" and earned a tidy sum.\\nEver since the Leisurely Puffer opened, it has also become more of a gathering place for watersports enthusiasts. Naturally, some among them are more into the sports aspect, and others are more focused on the equipment.\\nRegardless, ___ gradually experienced the joy of operating a business â€” the smiles on the faces of people when they receive something they love shine brighter than glittering gold.\\nWhat is this really what ___ wants to do the most? If you ask her that question, she'll definitely scratch her head:\\n\"Hey, life's a journey, you know, and you can keep on enjoying all kinds of scenery as long as it lasts! There's no rush to decide on a destination, especially when there's such a long way to go! That's what makes it so fun!\"",

Whenever she arrived someplace, she'd wander around, chatting with locals and asking about fun things to do nearby, good places to eat, or any unique local customs, and then decide on the spot what to do that day.\\nIf she really hit it off with someone, she'd happily invite them along. This usually developed into a lively party, or a fun excursion nearby.\\nAs long as ___ isn't running too short on time, she'll soon know \"the sights and places only the locals know\" like the back of her hand.\\nSometimes, other tourists and sightseers will ask her for directions, and as soon as she starts expounding on her knowledge of the area, it's hard to blame them for assuming she's a guide and offering her money to show them around.\\n___ would repeatedly wave her hands: \"A guide must ensure the safety of travelers, and that's way out of my league! Besides, I only just got here myself!\"\\nFriends visiting the People of the Springs from afar was when ___ really got to show her skills.\\nSome of her friends said she was a born guide, and others urged her:\\n\"Once you're a guide, take us to dragon ruins nobody else has even been to for a look! Maybe we'll find some valuable swag!\"\\n___ thought it all sounded very doable, so the next day, she went and found the famous guide, Nuu, and asked to be his student.\\nShe asked him, just what skills does a guide that wants to take people exploring need to master?\\nNuu thought for a second: \"First is wilderness survival, such as the behaviors of wild animals, the uses of and how to cook common plants, and how to pick a good campsite. Next is knowing the land itself, such as how to judge the direction of the tides and the length of time between eruptions. You must also have actually traveled across the landscape, traversing the canyons, caves, and volcanoes. Yes, spend about three years doing that, and you'll be ready to start learning.\"\\n___ was about to just turn and leave, but suddenly thought better of it. She did want to see many places she ordinarily wouldn't, and so she paid a huge sum as her tuition fee.\\nThough Nuu emphasized that reaching your destination safely was the most important thing, ___ could never resist seeing where the other fork in the road led. After all, what if there was some amazing treasure waiting to be found? And so, all kinds of accidents inevitably happened, like accidentally charging into Koholasaurus nests or falling into pits concealed by grasses.\\nBut ___ didn't fuss about such situations. To her, taking the wrong road helped her remember the right path, not to mention that sometimes, her misadventures led to windfalls â€” for example, finding an ore unknown to anyone in their time buried at the bottom of the pit.\\nLater, when she officially became a guide, she remembered her teacher's words, and planned the safest, most reliable routes for travelers. Still, a journey without happy accidents was kind of like an Apple Roly Poly without Apple, and that was completely unacceptable to ___.\\nOnce, she was taking some tourists to a plateau that commanded an expansive view. She suggested a group photo, and just as they had all gotten into their poses and chosen their expressions, just as ___ was lifting up the Kamera, a volcano in the distance suddenly erupted.\\n___ pressed the shutter in that very instant, and clapped and laughed at the resulting photo. \"A perfect shot! Go me! Guess I planned out the best spot for the picture, huh?\"\\nJust then, a massive rumbling caused the tourists to look at each other apprehensively. ___ reassured them:\\n\"Relax, it's totally safe at this distance! Next up, there'll be a few smaller eruptions. You'll never see anything else like it, so have a seat and enjoy the show!\"\\nThat's the kind of reliable guide ___ is, helping you reach your destination safely even amidst heart-stopping excitement.\\nShame, though, that even to this day, she's never found a Saurian relic that can fetch a decent price.",

Citlali â€” the high priestess of the Masters of the Night-Wind, who had left the tribe to live alone, was inside her home on the other side of the door, also pressed against it â€” "You\'re just taking some people out for a stroll, just what the heck kinda danger do you think there is? Don\'t overthink it, girl!"\\nSeparated only by Citlali\'s door, their epic struggle unfolded. It was only when Citlali finally threatened ___ with having to pay her back the full retail price for the door if it broke that peace finally reigned once more.\\nYet there was no way ___ would be discouraged so easily, so she brought a basket brimming with food on her next visit.\\nFried shrimp beanballs, blazed meat stew, Saurus crackers... Though Citlali by no means wished to entertain guests â€” well, she mostly just didn\'t want to bother tidying up her place â€” but for the sake of the food, she let her in.\\nAfter Citlali had eaten and drunk to her heart\'s content, ___ sought to strike while the iron was hot and take advantage of Citlali\'s good mood, unleashing her finishing move:\\n"Say, Granny, you know that a new volume of \'Mirage Warriors\' is coming out soon, don\'t you?"\\nCitlali was unfazed.

Apparently, the active volcano had already altered the terrain in the area.\\nFollowing Citlali\'s advice, she was able to lead the entire group to the original destination without incident, as expected.\\nFrom then on, ___ respectfully referred to Citlali as the "coolest elder," and often brought her all kinds of presents as she sought "life advice."

But the life she actually saw was nothing like that chronicled in the woven scrolls, filled with danger and excitement.\\nThe People of the Springs that ___ remembered had a really laid-back atmosphere, and they lived leisurely lives, never too hurried. When the big kahunas agreed to discuss some important matter or another, they\'d usually take a nice comfy soak in the hot springs first, then enjoy some snacks along with milk before finally slowly getting around to the actual business.\\nEven the music popular amongst the tribe tended to be really laid-back and mellow.\\nHearing those stories of distant battlefields as a child, the puzzled ___ once posed this question to an elder tasked to serve as a guardian:\\n"Is the Abyss a dangerous enemy? But then, why doesn\'t anybody seem nervous at all?"\\nThe elder guffawed, and she patted ___\'s head. "It\'s not all that scary. Once you\'re all grown up, you\'ll be able to defeat it too."\\n___ was still a bit confused, but it wasn\'t a very pressing concern, so she tossed it to the back of her mind for the time being and kept on growing up, without a care in the world.\\nUntil one night, when the Abyss suddenly attacked her tribe. ___ witnessed with her own eyes how the guardians strove against the monsters, and finally understood that the carefree life she had always enjoyed was not to be taken for granted.\\nFollowing the elders of the tribe, she slowly learned the ways of battle. Her long experience with watersports ensured that she had phenomenal physical capabilities, and she was like a charging shark in battle.\\nLater, she organized a team to participate in the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, but as the squad was mostly composed of newcomers, they quickly wiped out in the team round.\\nHer teammates were pretty dejected, but ___ was as cheerful as ever: "We managed to go a few rounds with the pros! That\'s already pretty awesome! Plus, we got a lot of experience, so we\'ll do even better next time!"\\nAnd just like she said, they steadily improved each time they participated, until finally, they earned their laurels and the right to participate in the Night Warden Wars.\\nThen, her impression of the Abyssal enemy was still that of her memories of the night from all those years ago: Huge, powerful, unstoppable. Yet when she and her companions came face-to-face with their foes, she unexpectedly found that she could take them down, one after another.\\n"Looks like today\'s my lucky day, I didn\'t run into anything too tough."\\nThis "good luck" never left her, and she participated in three Night Warden Wars and was victorious in all three, never even needing to be resurrected.\\nEach time she returned triumphant, the tribe would hold a huge hot springs party. Children who had heard tell of her experiences would run over and beg her to teach them her fighting techniques.\\n"I wanna be an awesome warrior like you, too!"\\nLooking at their innocent faces, ___ was reminded of her own childhood, and how she too and asked her elders questions. She smiled and waved her hands.\\n"The Abyss isn\'t that scary, you know! You should be having fun now â€” save the fighting stuff for when you\'re all grown up!"\\n"Oh, right!

She sped up, putting some distance between them: "In that case, let\'s race!"\\nAccepting her challenge, the freshwater shark pursued her relentlessly as ___ sped on ahead with everything she had, the spray laying a long white raceway for them.\\nAs they approached the coastline, the freshwater shark turned back in a fury, its hunt a failure. ___, not far away, waved back at it: "Let\'s play again next time!"\\nLater, she would encounter this same challenger in those same waters. ___ dubbed it "Sharky," and the two of them raced over and over. In the first few rounds, ___ was faster, but the shark was not to be outdone, and slowly closed the gap, until finally, it caught her.

Until one day, after they finished playing, Sharky circled her a few times, and then waved its caudal fin, swimming off in the direction of the setting sun.\\n___ waved as she usually did, but when she next went to her old spot to surf, she didn\'t see that speedy round shape as she normally did.\\n___ knew that any encounter is but a part of the journey, and that everyone eventually finds their new destination. Still, that doesn\'t mean the happiness that was shared must disappear.\\nSo thinking, ___ took out a piece of paper, and began to draw. Two weeks later, she handed the design for the "Sharky Surfboard" to an artisan she was familiar with. Sharky\'s fins were hard, but its tail was flexible. To achieve this, she chose her materials carefully, also recreating the texture of Sharky\'s skin, and even reproducing how its teeth meshed together.\\nAs for the color scheme, it naturally had to be eye-catching so that everyone who saw Sharky would remember what it looked like!\\nAnd so, with her new gear in tow, ___ was the center of attention once more. Amidst the ardent cries, the "Sharky Surfboard" was eventually mass-produced and sold to the public â€” though naturally, that version can\'t bite.\\nWhen ___ surfs, she occasionally wonders when the next time she\'ll get to race Sharky is. After all, ___ really wants to know just who is faster: Sharky Surfboard, or Sharky.',

Everyone was still soaking in the joyous afterglow when a loud sound in the distance shattered the quiet. It was wholly out of place, and made all the more clear by the night\'s prior tranquility.\\nEveryone was staring at each other uneasily, unsure of what had happened.

Every time she found one, she\'d relay the information to the guardians as they fought.\\nThere was one Pylon that was disgorging an inordinate number of monsters, and the warriors were pitted in a bitter struggle against them.

When they finally confirmed that all the Abyssal Pylons had been sealed, ___ followed behind Atea and the guardians, returning exhausted to the tribe.\\n___ noticed that everyone was injured to a greater or lesser extent.
