Well, the gist of it was \"to bear witness and judge is my great honor, but I am not a trial aficionado. Iudex is simply one of the hats I wear, and my time as a judge is but one phase of my life.\"\\nThis successful clarification led him out of the frying pan, and into the fire, as they say, with still more troublesome rumors emerging — \"Shocking News! ___ Claims 'Iudex' to be 'Springboard' Post!

In truth, however, there are many administrative affairs that he must handle in private to keep the justice system up and running.\\nDue to certain historical and traditional legacies in Fontaine, the Iudex also has the right to prosecute, as well as the power to enforce the law in person. This was originally intended to make it easier to maintain law and order during chaotic times, but as the system became further refined, this rule, which represented the spirit of the pioneer far more than that of the law, became maintained only symbolically. When the Iudex investigates a case or serves as the prosecutor, they must recuse themselves as judge, and have someone else take the seat. And in the few instances where he has personally investigated cases, ___ has unerringly followed this rule.\\nOne thing to note is that he has been the only Iudex in the land for a very long time, so much so that people often speculate that he must have been given an unimaginably long life due to divine favor. As such, it is well that he is nothing if not fair-minded, or such an extensive term would surely lead to problems someday.\\nAs to what he is precisely — a familiar of the Hydro Archon, or a mysterious Hydro elemental creature, perhaps — there are a great many opinions, though ___ has never once commented on such talk.\\nIndeed, he is a person most impartial.",

He would watch all manner of performances there, and the view was indeed excellent, just as Focalors had claimed.\\nWhat happened later was not made public knowledge. In all likelihood, the people had no way of understanding what it meant that the throne was shattered, or how the power of water was fully restored to its original owner. As to their being pardoned, and why they had to be forgiven in the first place, that was an even broader and more complex tale.\\nAnd thus did the curtain fall — Fontaine witnessed a happy ending to the greatest drama in history.\\nOr was it?

Before any outside life forms were ever created, all life on this planet traced its origins to the Primordial Sea. Indeed, those placid waters were worthy of the title of "birthing waters" or "amniotic fluid" given by those who came after. And the Hydro Dragon could, in turn, be regarded as this planet\'s original "God of Life."\\n___ knows all this, of course, just like he knows that all rivers meet again in the great ocean.

To continue to subdue and control the resentments and loathing of the world, the usurper and one who came after created the Gnoses together.
