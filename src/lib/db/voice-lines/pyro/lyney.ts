Not only has it allowed him and his sister to survive, but it has also allowed them to gain the \"acknowledgment\" that most children, growing up in a loving home, would have received from their parents.\\nEven from an early age, performance was something closely tied to ___'s life. Each time he would go on stage, ___ would have the audience whooping and clapping. And yet, he did not lose himself in their adulation — if anything, it often troubled him.\\nIf audiences were simply drawn to the spectacle of magic, then who was to say that they wouldn't abandon ___'s stage as soon as they caught wind of a more enthralling show in town?\\nIn other words, just as an audience would be attracted by petals and cards, they would also be pulled away by grander fireworks and crackling gun salutes. What else did magicians have up their sleeves to capture the hearts of their audience, beyond enticing them with ever more grandiose impressions of shock and awe?\\nIn all of ___'s performances afterward, audiences would begin to notice a change — ___ would add many segments between performances in which he would interact with them.\\nIndeed, this magician seemed without any airs, sharing various fascinating anecdotes about his life, not even minding if the audience should try to guess at the secret behind his tricks.\\nOf course, the sharper wits amongst them would notice that ___'s tales were not truth, but instead a way to build up the atmosphere, a bedding laid for a greater magic trick to land upon.\\nYet no one would quibble about these white lies. After all, truth and falsehoods were already inextricable in many parts of the performance — why, even the magician himself could be said to have become a part of the magic.\\nThus does ___ sometimes appear near and dear, and other times just out of the reach of his audience, balancing human affinity and magical mystery perfectly in the palm of his hand, his smile leaving the audiences' imaginations free to run wild.\\nNo matter how rich or poor, sad or glad the audience member, imagination is the great equalizer, carrying the charm of magic to all.\\nThus did the mystery and elegance of this magician spread far and wide, with people even opining that his skill at creating an atmosphere is itself as exquisite as magic.\\n\"Is that so? Well, I'm just trying to invite everyone to take a brief break from reality, that's all.\"",

The people here helped each other like a family would, greeting the fallout and consequences of those tragic years together.\\nBut the siblings, even with a recommendation from the manager of the Hotel, did not find it all that easy to fit in, nor was it easy for the children there to immediately accept these new \"outsiders.\"\\nAnd in this environment, oppressive in its gloom, the water pumping equipment broke while Lynette was using it, right before everyone's eyes, deepening the distrust to the extreme.\\n___ could only step up and take responsibility, agreeing to fix the equipment so as not to affect everyone's daily lives.\\nIn truth, he did not know all that much about repair work, but given Lynette's propensity for damaging various small devices, he had long gotten used to following his intuition to do some fixes here and there.\\nUnfortunately, he underestimated the complexity of the pumping equipment and difficulty of fixing it. While he succeeded in restoring it to normal operations, he remained at a complete loss as to whether he had solved the root problem or not, he could not tell.\\nBut just as he was at his wit's end, a seemingly reticent young fellow stepped forth, examined, and restored the facilities, even expressing his apologies.\\nAs it turned out, he was the one in charge of maintenance at the Hotel, and as he saw it, Lynette had been the unfortunate victim of his failure to detect and replace the aging components in the system in a timely manner.\\n___, for his part, was far more impressed by the young fellow's skills than any talk of responsibility. He wanted to learn from the youth — if nothing else, this would make helping Lynette all the easier.\\nThe youth was, for his part, no good at refusing, and thus did ___ become his assistant in the Hotel's small workroom — and over time, he and this Freminet would become friends.\\n___ would prove unselfish in spending time on other Hotel residents, whether it be Freminet or others, but he would keep them company in comforting silence rather than ask them about their experiences.\\nIn this he was guided by Lynette's succinct life advice: \"No one needs self-satisfied concern.\"\\nIn time, the residents became more willing to share some of their pasts with him, and ___ would thus become better able to help them with their issues.\\nFreminet was somewhat perplexed by this, believing that ___, who was slowly becoming the core around which the Hotel spun, did not need to go this far.\\n___ joked that he had helped Freminet when they first met because he knew that his sister would cause further machine-related troubles down the line, and he was uncomfortable with that.\\nBut at this point, there was no fooling Freminet with such words. Under his attentive gaze, ___ could only tell him the truth.\\n\"Because Lynette's my one and only family, I've learned from her how one should treat all members of their family.\"",

The children danced to the joyous music playing from the grand hall\'s phonograph and enjoyed delicious food — this was the birthday of no one in particular, but this was the day they all felt they had gained new lives.\\nThe finale, of course, was ___, Lynette, and Freminet\'s Founding Day magic show.

The crowd cheered, amazed — then fell suddenly into stunned silence.\\nWhat stood onstage was no present — nay, this was the Hotel\'s manager, its owner, and their "Father."\\nHer image was one of unsmiling dignity, and thus, though she did not come by often, no one dared to horse around whenever she was around.\\nSurely, ___ had gone completely mad to have her make her appearance in such a frivolous way.\\nYet, upon seeing the crowd\'s reaction, "Father" did not snap at anyone, opining merely that ___ had kept this secret perfectly, just as a magic show should, declaring it worthy of praise.\\nThat night, the children and their "Father" delighted in the various desserts together, and she personally sliced a serving of cake for each of them, which she herself enjoyed some of as well.\\nPerhaps the most amazing aspect of ___\'s Founding Day magic show was its ability to have even "Father" lay down her heavy burden and enjoy a brief moment of familial love.',
