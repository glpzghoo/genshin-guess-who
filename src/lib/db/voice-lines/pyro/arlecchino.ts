Indeed, nearby residents have not even heard of her.\\nThe signature on the relevant documentation is but a false identity â€” the real power lies with someone else.\\nIf one could hear the children whisper at night behind the Hotel\'s closed gates, one would hear this appellation: "Father."\\nWhen speaking of "Father," some faces turn worshipful, some hearts are seized with fear, and still others look inscrutable, torn â€” but their tone always becomes one of respect.\\nThese children are part of the organization known as the House of the Hearth. They belong to the Fatui.\\nThis place is home to orphans the world over, and the luxurious Hotel is but one of the House\'s faces.\\nAs for this "Father," the master of the House, she is none other than ___, ___, presently Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers.\\nThe Fatui â€” and this Harbinger â€” enjoy a mixed reputation. But to most of these children, "Father" is the most important figure in their lives.\\n"It is only because \'Father\' is here that this place is truly like a \'home.\'"',

"The unknown" has, after all, ever been the source of all dread.\\nEven the children, who interact with her on a day-to-day basis, cannot claim to understand her. Not her hobbies, her dislikes, or the things on her mind when she gazes out to sea.\\nEach August, they rack their brains thinking of birthday presents for her, and yet her reactions to each gift are virtually the same.\\nThis continued until last year, when Freminet was given a nasty shock by a lizard that leaped down from the ceiling.

What happened to that lizard?"\\n"It attempted to open the box lid a few times, so I gave it back its freedom. Our acquaintance was brief indeed, but that was the choice life made."\\n___\'s voice was completely calm. Looking at the confused Lyney, she then directed a casual finger at a bird that was poking about at the windowsill.\\n"Ah, yes. Not long after it left, the lizard became this one\'s lunch. Now it seems to want me to serve it seconds... Go chase it away."',
