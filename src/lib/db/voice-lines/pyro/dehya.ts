Procuring her service runs an expensive premium, but her abilities make that a worthy expenditure indeed.\\nCompared to those overconfident fools hawking their talents as hired blades on the street and novices capable of little more than brute force, ___ is a conscientious professional.\\nWith all this said, those who wish to procure her services should make haste, for there is a long line of other potential clients that have need of the Flame-Mane, and the opportunity, just as grains in the desert, will slip away before long.',

Even so, the other mercenaries have a great many reasons to hold her in high regard.\\nFirstly, though she is not the strongest in her profession, she has force enough all the same.\\nShould one doubt this, they merely need to test the weight of her blade. To make such a greatsword dance and flow without sufficient strength would be impossible otherwise.\\nSecondly, she has tremendous combat instincts. It is known that the greatsword, ___'s weapon of choice, demands a trade-off between force and speed. Should such a weapon fail to achieve a decisive first strike against a sufficiently mobile foe, it will prove more burden than a boon for the wielder. In moments like these, ___ uses her superior insight and technique to overcome the opposition.\\nSometimes, she will cast her weapon aside, eschewing the edge of a sword for the weight behind her fists. She will even hurl her weapon at foes without warning to buy a fleeting opportunity. How any such moment plays out all depends on the actual conditions presented by each battle.\\nAside being good in a fight, she also knows plenty about surviving in the desert.\\nThe commissions that the Eremites most often take will have them serving as bodyguards against raiders without outside support, herding away dangerous creatures, and assisting their clients in avoiding dreaded weather conditions.\\nSometimes, they even find assignments that have them acting as guides, helping caravans, adventurers, and researchers reach their desired destinations.\\n___ knows how to deal with startled scorpion swarms, how to circle around vultures to avoid getting entangled with those nimble annoyances, and how to negotiate and minimize danger when faced with robbers.\\nClients like it when matters are handled thoroughly and practically. To earn true praise from their employers, mercenaries must offer more than just brute capacity for violence.\\nIndeed, the ability to overcome one hundred or even a thousand foes has its limits, for when sandstorms scour the earth and sky, even the mightiest warrior will be buried beneath its shroud.\\nA wise mercenary knows when to retreat, and how to preserve themselves even while meeting their objectives, for doing so exemplifies the true heights of strategy.",

They chittered and clamored, trying to give ___ a vicious moniker capable of instilling debilitating terror in potential clients, usually beginning with "bloody" or "terror."\\n___ was not such an amateur as to think that a title alone might encapsulate the entirety of what others felt about her. But still, as if everyone wanted to kill some time on this matter, she didn\'t mind.\\nAs she listened to bad suggestion after terrible suggestion, she couldn\'t help but guffaw with laughter. The atmosphere reminded her of moments from her childhood when her father gathered his compatriots to put on plays for her, detailing chivalrous heroes defending the helpless or messy brawls between siblings to amuse everyone. There was no specific point to it, except to bring some cheer while surviving in the vast emptiness under the desert\'s midnight sky.\\nAnd just as the chatting was starting to put her in a good mood, that old ne\'er-do-well\'s shadow slid back into her mind. Though admittedly disgruntled, ___ did her best to keep the curl of her lips imperceptible.\\nThat night, ___ rejected several laughable names, such as the "Sovereign of the Sands" and "The Crimson Edge." She thought it was time to let the farce come to a close. It was just a name after all, and true mercenaries did not let such things affect their business much.\\nJust then, an aged mercenary interrupted the discussion.

This story ring a bell for anyone?"\\nThis tale was, naturally, one ___ was familiar with. During her childhood, her father had told her lots of old stories — far too many, really. She had wanted to forget everything that had to do with him, but memories are not so easily consigned to oblivion.\\nWhile she was lost in the twists and turns of her past, her companions decided upon a title for her that actually sounded quite alright: "Flame-Mane."\\nAnd though she loathed the man The Legend of the Lion reminded her of, she found herself halted just before she could reject the name. Was it not all too petty to refuse such goodwill on that account?\\nMust she avoid all the things related to her father, just because she wanted to forget him? Of course not. Besides, the story had brought a genuine feeling of warmth and comfort to ___, allowing her to face the world with open eyes, experience all it had to offer — and those experiences had not been falsehoods.\\nSo why not take up the title of "Flame-Mane?"

If she hadn\'t encountered the miraculous creations of the Akademiya, tasted the fine wines of Mondstadt, beheld the elaborately crafted utensils from Liyue, or the mechanical brilliance possessed by the people of Fontaine, she too would have been unable to see past the borders of her environment.\\nMeasured on merits of courage alone, the folk of the rainforest pale before the tenacious desertfolk.
