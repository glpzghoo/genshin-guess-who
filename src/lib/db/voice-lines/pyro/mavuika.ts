Even newly-arrived travelers need only hear her speak at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame to know that she merits being known as the sun.\\nShe is exceedingly awe-inspiring, but is no unsmiling ruler whose ways may as well be set in stone. In informal situations, she is an enthusiastic and friendly big-sister figure, always ready to chat, and ever open to reasonable suggestions.\\nOn the eve of the Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame, the Weary Inn is often packed with passionate revelers, and ___ can often be found there, playing cards or singing songs with everyone, and even if some drunk person splashes their drink onto her, she doesn\'t mind at all.\\nAfter all, for someone who can ignite their hair to dry off said drink, such incidents are small beans. When such levity is hard to come by, why let something so minor spoil the mood?\\nBut should the person intend to start a drinking contest, it is ___\'s desire to win that will be kindled. As the "battle" has begun, there can be no room for retreat or surrender. The victor will be determined, one way or the other.\\nSince becoming Archon, her habits have remained utterly unchanged, and this has allowed her to make many friends across the tribes.\\nHowever, not everyone possesses the subtle sense of proper propriety for such a relationship. Indeed, she can be too down-to-earth, and with her lack of airs, some misjudge the situation and get the false impression that they can use their friendship with an Archon to their own benefit.\\nStrangely enough, though people of this sort are a dime a dozen, they have never caused any major trouble, for ___ has never responded to such ridiculous requests — a solemn, icy stare is all she needs to send the other party scampering away.\\nThe sight of those ever-burning eyes casting such a frigid gaze wakes those confused fools up in an instant to the fact that ___ is still the leader of a nation, a supreme deity.\\nA Speaker\'s Chamber staff member once suggested that she should subject those who so harass her to at least token punishment, lest there be an endless stream of incidents to come, but she refused.\\n"Archonhood is status, authority, and a spiritual symbol. But it is not who \'I\' am."',

      text: 'Theoretically, anyone in Natlan can become the Pyro Archon, so long as they prove that they are the mightiest warrior of their era during a Pilgrimage.\\nTherefore, the rulers of the nation have varied wildly in personality and style. Some worshipped power and strength, valuing results. To them, any price was acceptable so long as the ends could be achieved.\\n___ is just the opposite. In the eyes of others, she is undoubtedly your typical "perfectionist" — not only must things be done well, but also beautifully.\\nTo pursue quality and completeness is only human, but doing so often requires extra time. And whenever anyone tells her that such an approach isn\'t efficient enough, ___ has a set of arguments at the ready.\\nFirst, there are no standalone events in this world. Tracing events backward reveals causes, while moving forward reveals outcomes. Humans are incapable of analyzing the whole chain of events. All they can do is handle each one as best they can, and avoid leaving hidden pitfalls.\\nSecond, all past events become valuable experiences. Successes serve as references, and failures as lessons. But if matters were dealt with carelessly, all they will leave are warnings to not repeat the same mistakes.\\nBut apart from these two ideas, ___ also has a very important reason for her approach that she rarely ever mentions — and that is "fun."\\nShe has a broad range of hobbies, and has unparalleled skill in the various sports and games popular across the tribes, but one sentence can sum up all of these interests — she loves getting better at things.\\nFor example, when she first learned how to rock climb, she would commit every movement her coach made to memory and ask in detail about every last maneuver.\\nHer next step was to train — and train a lot, making her body remember the trick behind each movement, gradually executing them faster and faster. She even requested someone to record the entire process with a Kamera, all the better to later study any failures or areas where she wasn\'t fluid enough.\\nShe would also talk with her coach and use various tools and equipment in order to solve problems she encountered, enumerating lists of solutions, and trying out each one in turn before choosing the best.\\nIn this way, ___ honed her climbing skills to perfection most quickly indeed, and her questions grew ever harder for her coach to answer, eventually shifting their relationship from that of teacher and student to that of fellow lovers of climbing, delving into their craft together.\\nIn other fields, there were even more exaggerated cases. In some cases, ___ would come to surpass "masters" with three to four decades of experience after just a single year of study.\\nThe reason behind this was actually quite simple: Building up skills is easy, but maintaining progress is hard. Once memories have sunk into one\'s body, it becomes easy for one to grow self-satisfied and complacent, and thus cease to actively think.\\nAs such, one thing ___ detests is repetition: If a deed done before must be done again, then it must be done differently in some way, whether by trying something new, or else through reflection and optimization.\\nBut it is difficult for most to see all the effort that she puts into this, and thus, her swift progress is often put down to talent. To this, she can only wryly smile, for who in this world was born with such a surfeit of talent?\\n"If you want to improve, all you have to do is master the \'skill\' of improvement and then just put in the work."',

When not at work or training, she can be seen in all sorts of places, throwing herself at various extreme challenges.\\nBut what people often fail to realize is that she actually can also sit still for long periods of time, staying focused as she reads books and woven scrolls, as she possesses ample patience.\\nHer other great indoor hobby is solving puzzles, whether these involve logical reasoning or pattern recognition, and regardless if their contents are images, numbers, or even stories. All quickly suck her into a world of her own.\\nAfter enjoying time well-spent making deductions and decisions, she even scores these puzzles based on their quality, difficulty, and reasonability, so that her fellow puzzle hobbyists have a reliable standard to refer to.\\nYet this hobby of hers came to pose a problem: Puzzle games are usually one-time sources of enjoyment and lack replayability, and ___ tends to solve them all too quickly, faster even than the ability of puzzle creators to develop new ones.\\nAs such, while keeping an eye on any new puzzles that come to market, ___ also dusts off already-solved puzzles and adds various restrictions and limitations to increase the difficulty or complexity.\\nFor example, while doing a puzzle, she might allow herself to select pieces normally, but flip the pieces when placing them, thus only being able to see if she has the puzzle right after placing every piece and flipping the whole thing back over.\\nOr perhaps, if the puzzle requires separating multiple connected pieces of metal, she will affix one piece to the table, thus restricting the number of directions in which she can conveniently pull the pieces apart, requiring her to consider alternatives — a restriction that can also be applied to knot puzzles.\\nOver time, she has compiled the various gameplay challenges she has come up with and puzzle ratings she has given, creating a most valuable curated catalog of puzzles.\\nAt first, she published it at the Speaker's Chamber, hoping that she could help her fellow hobbyists, and also promote this relatively niche hobby while she was at it, but the quickest to seize upon the utility of the resource she created were, in fact, the sellers of puzzles.\\nThey used the recommendation of the Pyro Archon herself to shamelessly peddle their puzzles, but this quickly led to numerous disputes — approval though it be, ___'s catalog only indicated her personal preference, while the full scope of human taste in puzzles is vast indeed.\\nFollowing that incident, ___ no longer publicly discloses her catalog, but if one truly considers oneself a puzzle enthusiast, one can still go to the Speaker's Chamber and request to view it.\\n...With the caveat that you must first prove yourself an expert by solving a random puzzle selected from ___'s collection by the Chamber staff, of course.",

As this repeated time and again, her mother came to realize how her own reckless behavior must have seemed inappropriate in the eyes of others.\\n___ matured faster than any other child her age, and very quickly, the knowledge she had gleaned from her father allowed her to point out her mother's rashness, and the experiences she had with her mother allowed her to identify her father's overly idealistic thinking.\\nLike a bridge, she stood between two people who could not at first communicate easily with one another, slowly dissolving the many contradictions and misunderstandings that had accumulated over time. When her father taught her martial arts, her mother would give pointers from the side, and when her mother took her to train Saurians, her father would also come along.\\nBut the thing that really pushed ___ to take another step forward was the birth of another angel into the house — her sister, Hine.\\nPerhaps it was because ___ had already taken on responsibilities important to the family's relationships that she quickly got used to the role of an older sister, and step by step, she passed on all that she had learned from her parents to Hine.\\nHine was by no means easy to handle. She was naughty at times, quiet at others, and rarely obedient, which often resulted in the other three household members seated at the table simultaneously facepalming with a sigh. But even these were moments filled with warmth.\\nOnce, when ___ and her father were teaching her, Hine asked a question:\\n\"If all the Pyro Archons are just humans, how can we be sure that every person who becomes one will be willing to protect us?\"\\n\"It's precisely because we are all ordinary people that we don't need such guarantees.\"\\n\"Daddy, I don't get it! You're talking in riddles again.\"\\n\"Ask your sister, then. I'm certain she's figured this one out already — a long while ago, in fact.\"\\n___ simply smiled and hugged her sister, patting her on her head, and said nothing more on the matter.",

Rather, it was forged by countless heroes, past and present. Rather than a "savior," then, ___ preferred to be known as an "agent."\\nBut this alone was not enough. Her journey was no penance that required only willpower, but rather, decisiveness and wisdom also.\\nShe could never have foreseen such marked variables as the Traveler or The Captain five hundred years prior, but upon learning of them, she only needed a moment\'s consideration before deciding to incorporate them into the plan.\\nIn addition to any other considerations she might have had based on the realities of the situation, another factor played into her judgment — that both the Traveler and The Captain exhibited traits that mirrored her own.\\nWere it not for their respective positions, she would have liked nothing more than for the three of them to sit and speak of their travels over grilled meat and drinks.

After all, in critical situations, the quickest path is always a straight line.\\nIt also needed sufficient explosive power, such that it could serve as a weapon when necessary. After all, in the event of an Abyssal attack, time spent tangling with monsters was time wasted.\\nThen, it had to be sufficiently compatible with Pyro, such that she could summon it with a mere flick of her wrist.\\n"These are my requirements. Well within your capabilities, right, Xilonen?"\\n"Wha...?"\\nEven by themselves, each of her criteria was difficult to fulfill. Put together, the task was truly outrageous.

In the process, they discovered that their original assumptions were too simplistic. It was impossible to get all the key components they needed from existing material.\\nThe solution, then, was to use modern smithing techniques to create said parts independently and combine the two elements — a process that involved lots of overheating and explosions en route to solving the Pyro compatibility issue that Source Mechanisms had.\\nAfter a long period of development, the prototype Flamestrider was at last complete. No one had ever seen such a beastly creation with such powerful capabilities before, and people lined up to see and applaud it.\\nThus did the leader who protects Natlan gain yet another guaranteed source of strength.\\nAlso worth mentioning is the fact that Xilonen declined to take part in the vehicle testing phase that followed, claiming that she had "forgotten to make a second helmet."

It was at this time that her father achieved victory in the Pilgrimage, and was soon to embark on a glorious journey.\\nIn the culture and traditions of Natlan, to obtain this privilege is to become a hero, and ___ was immensely proud of her father for having done so. Thus, when her father came to say his farewells, she couldn\'t really understand the disquiet on her mother\'s face.\\nIt was very uncommon for a team fighting in the Night Warden Wars to be completely wiped out, and even should some fall, their lives\' flames would be rekindled by the Ode of Resurrection so long as the unit dispatched achieved victory.\\nAt last, news of victory came to the Stadium. It had been three days and nights of vicious battle, and had cost three out of seven warriors, ___\'s father being among them.\\nThough she was somewhat worried, ___ knew the Rite of Rekindling to be akin to a victory feast. Her father would return to them from the Sacred Flame, just as she remembered, and their family would be reunited.\\nBut, contrary to her expectations, her father was covered in wounds from head to toe, so much so that he could not even stand on his own two feet.\\nThe Ode of Resurrection could rekindle life, but only the fatal wound could be reversed. The wounds that had slowly accumulated as the battle raged on or pre-existing ailments would not be cured. And it was precisely the length of the battle that had brought her father low.\\nThis was the first time ___ had seen her father in such a weak state, and the first time she felt the gaze of "death" fixed on her. It was still a thing to be respected and feared, even with the Ode at hand.\\nHaving rarely cried in her life, ___ held her tears back this time, too. She simply lowered her head in silence, gripping her father\'s hand as he lay in his sickbed, her heart filled, in truth, more with regret than sadness.\\nPerceiving her thoughts, her father told her that this was the truth of "war," that all fear death, but that some would always step forth to fight, because they had something they wished to protect.\\nBut the world of children is not yet governed by so many expectations, and she did not understand why her father, and indeed, all the grown-ups, were willing to shoulder the duty of war.\\n"Since we\'re forced to fight this war, then I wish to put an end to it."\\n___\'s eyes flashed like flames as she spoke, and her parents looked at one another, some certainty dawning. They did not rush to deny that notion on account of their daughter\'s "naivete." Instead, they nodded.\\nHer parents\' acknowledgment steeled her initial resolve, and thus did the gaze of the gods come to rest upon her. And though she would later learn many secrets and know more about the crisis that Natlan faced, she would never doubt the trust she once saw in their eyes.\\nShe believed that this was something that only she could do — not only because she was "Kiongozi" ___, but also because she was her parents\' daughter, their pride and joy. She was a daughter of the Scions of the Canopy — a daughter of Natlan.',
