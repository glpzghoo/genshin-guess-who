But Fontainians are quite familiar with such matters, quickly ascertaining the gravity of an offense and deciding on a course of action based on the identity of the one sent to deal with the matter.\\nIf it is only a member of the establishment's staff, then perhaps a simple debate will be sufficient to resolve the issue; who doesn't enjoy a lively atmosphere? If it is a uniformed Gestionnaire, then all onlookers will have to suffer through an insufferably long-winded admonishment, and it's best to vacate the premises. If it is an officer of the Maison Gardiennage, then the parties involved won't get off scot-free, and may even have to pay fines. In this case, it's best to immediately clarify that you are an innocent bystander, and are in no way involved with the case.\\nHowever, if the one to come calling is the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with her tall cap and musket slung across her back, along with a squad of Special Patrol officers...\\nWell, that means a particularly vicious case is unfolding, or perhaps a hoodlum is to be violently apprehended, or some fiendish felon has kidnapped a hostage... In any case, the only thing to do in such a situation is to quickly evacuate in accordance with the instructions given by the Special Patrol and give these \"Felon Management Specialists\" room to work their magic. At the same time, keep a tight leash on your curiosity and do not attempt to conceal yourself in a nearby hidey-hole. seeking to observe their law-enforcement activities from a close distance. Even if you wish to interview them, then wait until their work is done.\\nMost importantly, there's no need to feel unsafe, and even less cause for fear.\\nFor as all Fontainians know, any hope criminals have to escape the long arm of the law flees whenever Captain ___ is on the scene.",

Still, though they have long since matured into adults, they cannot help but stand up a bit straighter when they see Captain ___, averting their gaze and instinctually wringing their hands, mortally afraid that they might have committed some offense worthy of arrest without having even been aware of the nature of their crime. Yet despite being crystal clear that these fine officers are fighting crime, and regardless of their reverence for such upstanding upholders of the law, it is truly difficult to suppress the urge to tense up...\\nAs for this "fearsome, infamous reputation," the Special Patrol themselves are quite exasperated. A member once suggested to ___ that allowing such an "infamous reputation" to circulate is damaging to the Special Patrol\'s image: "The Special Patrol is an official law enforcement office under the Maison Gardiennage, after all, and if our methods of enforcing the law are more forceful, and the process thereof more intense, it\'s only because the criminals we deal with are the most vile and violent of them all. So to use the Special Patrol\'s good name to frighten children really is a bit..."\\n"Why not let ___ give The Steambird an interview? Let our Captain stress that the Special Patrol is a law enforcement organization only focused on dealing with the worst offenders, and everything it does is to safeguard Fontaine\'s safety and stability, in pursuit of which it would never accost citizens without good cause..."\\nYet ___ vetoed this suggestion.\\n"If such a reputation has really become so deeply embedded in the minds of the people, and it sticks with them for a lifetime, then there\'s a chance that when someone considers taking things a step too far, fear inspired by our \'infamous reputation\' may pull them back from the edge."\\n"...If so, then there\'ll be no need for us to actually take them away someday."',

Their every word and action reflects on the Maison Gardiennage, and represents the laws of the Court of Fontaine, so there is zero room for errors or negligence.\\nHowever, the way the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol of the Court of Fontaine does things is markedly different from other law enforcement agencies. Members are not required to use standardized weapons, nor must they wear uniforms outside of formal occasions... Additionally, after ___ took command of the Special Patrol, many of its members began using muskets as part of their law enforcement arsenals, and some even began to refuse to go on missions with Gardemeks on the basis that not only can an immobile meka block their line of fire, but there\'s a distinct danger of criminals taking control of said meka and turning them against the squad. Furthermore, when selecting recruits, the Special Patrol will even accept the descendants of criminals whose households had been stripped of all honor...\\nFor the sake of quickly solving the most heinous of cases, the Maison Gardiennage is willing to overlook all those issues, displaying great forbearance towards ___ and the Special Patrol. But what they simply cannot abide is how ___ is willing to invite serious felons to participate in cases she is handling as "special consultants."\\nThough ___ stridently maintains that this is purely to catch vicious criminals as soon as possible, many colleagues still believe that relying on lawbreakers to help arrest lawbreakers is an insult to both the laws of Fontaine and those who enforce them. Should such humiliations continue, what dignity would remain for the Maison Gardiennage and the law itself?\\nFaced with such pointed questions, ___ always gives the same simple response:\\n"The greatest insult to the law is a criminal roaming free and unpunished."\\n"And as for the \'dignity\' of the Maison Gardiennage, it isn\'t even worthy of comparison with the safety of the Court of Fontaine."\\nThis, too, is one of her father\'s teachings.',

Sometimes he would return exceptionally late, bringing his daughter sweet treats. Alas, having long since already brushed her teeth, it was also too late for her to have any more sugar.\\nSuch gifts were a rare treat, and yet their luster would fade by morning, and so ___\'s mother would allow little ___ to lick a bit of cream off before sending said dessert to her father\'s bedroom along with a cup of coffee.\\nAt this time, her father would always be facing a wall covered in pictures and thumbtacks, at times staring blankly at it, at others pacing in circles, smoking, tousling his hair, and sometimes raising his fists in sudden triumph, before slowly lowering them and helplessly pounding the table— ___ bore silent witness to all this, peeping in from behind the door.\\nSometimes, when she ran into her father on the street, she would excitedly wave, but at most he would return a slight smile before throwing himself back into his myriad tasks.\\n"He\'s an upright, good man."\\nHer mother, neighbors, his colleagues, and even the kids next door all praised her father thusly.\\nBut one day, those colleagues who were always praising her father as an upstanding man suddenly came knocking at her door.\\nHer mother was at a complete loss as she watched them come and go from her home.

Her father\'s colleagues often came by in plainclothes, bringing all kinds of gifts with them. In addition to their presents, they brought news as well. They told her mother of the appeal they were all working so hard on — not just the Gardes and the members of the Special Patrol, but even several Gestionnaires who oft worked with them — and how despite the fact Donatello had broken the law was indisputable and established fact, and legally speaking his sentence could not be commuted or shortened, they at least could ensure he didn\'t need to endure further castigation. It was all of scant comfort to her mother, whose worries did not subside.\\nTo take care of her mother, ___ didn\'t hesitate to take up burdens that one as young as she should never have had to shoulder, stepping into the dark currents that swirled through the Fleuve Cendre.\\nPerhaps it was because the residents of the Fleuve Cendre had heard tell of or been on the receiving end of her upright father\'s care that so many helping hands were extended to her. A well-meaning shop owner gave her a job, and the couple next door often took care of her infirm mother.\\nAnd when the children of the Fleuve Cendre heard that the child of a Garde had come to live among them, they flocked to her like plaintiffs and defendants, seeking her arbitration on all manner of quarrels and disputes.\\n"___!

She knew full well that her father had leaked classified intelligence regarding a major case to utilize the resulting interest from the press to assist in investigating that criminal.

Without question, she was first in her class, and her pursuit of "justice" was widely admired by other members.\\nBut the officer in charge of them, Vice Captain Grizzetti, disagreed, and he never selected ___ for field missions.

But Uncle Grizzetti had already sunk into eternal silence.\\nNow, only ___ and the killer remained. The howling wind and torrential downpour would conceal the sound of another gunshot, and the Special Patrol... They might not inquire too closely in the case of how this fiend who had murdered one of their colleagues had been shot dead.\\nBut more importantly, the killer was right in front of her. If she wished to carry out justice, now was the time. She lifted her musket, aimed right between his eyes... and then lowered the gun.\\nThe Special Security and Surveillance Patrol speaks only in the name of justice, and true "justice" can only be decided by the courts. Perhaps this was what it meant to be "ready" to become a member of the Special Patrol.\\n"This is the Court of Fontaine Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You are under arrest."\\nNo sooner had she finished speaking than the killer began to hobble away, seeking to flee without the slightest hesitation. With the crack of a musket, the man was struck squarely in his right leg. He cried out in agony, cursing as he rolled on the ground, finally coming to a stop before the feet of the other Patrol members who had rushed over.\\nThe "justice" of the law is meted out by the courts, but as for ___\'s own personal justice, that is carried out by her alone.\\nAs ___ finally completely lowered her musket, she had yet to notice a Vision was now hanging from the stock.\\nIn the lashing wind and rain, its glow was not readily apparent, much like justice yet to be revealed — pale and dark.',
