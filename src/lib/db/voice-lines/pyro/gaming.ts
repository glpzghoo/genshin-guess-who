The one thing that did not change was his passion for Wushou Dance, and still he dreamed of making it big in Liyue Harbor one day. But compared to Yilong Wharf, things were different there. In Liyue Harbor, Wushou Dance was seen as a new-ish folk practice that originated in Chenyu Vale — it was appreciated, sure, but it was no money-maker, and certainly not ingrained in people's hearts in the same way Liyue opera was.\\nThe more ___'s father watched his son bustle about tirelessly, the more he worried about the youth's future, and not a few times did he speak seriously with the boy about the difficulties of starting a business. And each time, ___ would retort that staying in business was harder yet, and declined to succeed his father in the tea leaf business. In earlier years, when his mother was still around, any impasse between the two could be broken up around the dinner table, but after she passed from illness, it was as if the glue from this father-son relationship had come unstuck, and they grew distant.\\n___'s father blamed her falling ill on the immense amount of labor she had put into starting the business with him, and by extension, himself. If something were to happen to their only son, how could he ever face her? And thus, when ___ was once again injured when practicing Wushou Dance, he could take no more, and gave all of his son's equipment away, leaving only the beast head his wife had made. To his shock, ___ left without a word the very next day, taking said head with him.\\nIn truth, his son's departure did not only leave him angry, but also stewing in a melange of emotions and wavering reflection. He had in fact been constantly asking those close to him at the Communications Office to help take care of his son over the years, but whenever ___ came up in conversation, his words could be brutal and blunt — nor would he put aside his pride to proactively mend relations.\\nLeong, an assistant to the business, would write to ___ come every festival, discussing some awkward matters that were neither here nor there — and of course, even a witless twit could guess that he was doing so at the behest of ___'s father. Even so, ___ was not as headstrong and free-spirited as he often appeared, and he never exposed Leong, instead going along with the letters, even asking after matters at home, intentionally or otherwise...\\nTo ___, reading Leong's letters was akin to defusing a bomb, and in truth, he sometimes hoped to receive nothing at all. Just as he once feared that the villagers might come and say \"Your father's on his way to give you a good whooping,\" he now feared that someone might say \"Your father was at home when he had a fall\"... Whether then or now, no news was good news.\\nThus did father and son continue to be stubborn, each seemingly convinced that the other would understand them in time... Gladsome was it, then, that ever-ardent Ms. Xianyun would intercede before such reticence could turn to regret. With the bridge she built, and with the aid of able allies, ___'s father was finally able to center himself and find calm, finishing watching his son's masterful, exciting Wushou Dance performance. From awkwardness to active dialog they went, and at last, they were again able to open up to each other, with ___'s father accepting his son's career choice.\\n\"Well, remember to come watch next time I perform in Liyue Harbor.\"\\n\"I don't need you to tell me that.\"\\n\"In that case, don't chat too long over dim sum, or you might not be able to squeeze your way in when you come late...\"\\n\"You rascal!\"",

All this agitation is simply no good for anyone. Don't blame your dad, he's more bark than bite. He's just concerned that you'll have a tough time on your own in the future and doesn't want you to go through such hardships. Do you remember that time when you sprained your leg? Your father was so anxious that he ran frantically to the physician, with you on his back. He was worried sick, and he secretly cried under the blankets that night. You are a big boy now, do show some consideration for your dad and let him have his way sometimes. Don't quarrel with your dad if you can help it...\"\\n\"...Don't worry, I'm not against you learning Wushou Dance. In fact, I'm glad that you found something you like and enjoy doing while you were young. But you have to promise me to be careful and not force yourself so you don't get hurt! And please be careful not to eat anything too heaty, cold or raw, and don't be too picky about what you eat and drink... Remember to wear more layers when it's stormy and raining, don't neglect keeping yourself warm just because you want to look cool!\"\\n\"...As you step into society, you have to stay true to yourself. Don't let yourself or others down. The worst thing you can do is to make empty promises and be someone who is 'all talk, no action.'\"\\n\"There's no harm in knowing more people. If you find a friend who you can really connect with, you absolutely must treat them well with a sincere heart. It's not about the number of friends you have but the quality of your friendships. You should count yourself lucky if you find someone you can rely on. I know you won't want to talk to your dad about things that are bothering you, so just find a friend whom you can share your woes with. No matter what you do, don't bottle up your feelings, and definitely don't do anything silly, alright?\"\\n\"I'm feeling a little tired, so I'll take a rest now.

But I want you to know that you're not a little rascal and that you're so, so much better than a piece of char siu... You will always be my little boy that I cherish and love most in the world...\"\\nJudging from the creases, the letter has been opened and put away again and again.

Please, has she ever opened the book herself? Oh, oops, pretend I didn't say anything!

Having asked his seniors, he found out that they had never seen a real one either, and they had relied on their teachers to hand down the art of Wushou Dance to them. If he really wanted to find out, it was going to be an adventure unto itself.\\nRandom chance allowed him to borrow a few old texts about the solitary Suanni hidden in the mountains from Xingqiu. Several nights did he do battle against the unfamiliar words that rushed his position like a relentless army of ants, only to be defeated at last, remembering only a few key phrases like "fierce," "majestic," and "untamed."\\nA giant beast of most heroic bearing indeed! He was sure that if only he could lay eyes upon it, he would gain much inspiration for his Wushou Dance performances. It was with this belief that ___ would often poke about the locations the books mentioned. And when he came to Mt. Lingmeng, he sensed an oppressive aura about, as if a pair of eyes hidden in the bushes were watching him. This was it, ___ intuited.\\nBefore dawn broke the next day, he made himself presentable, and brought his favorite beast head and a big bag of food offerings into the mountains. Suddenly, a strong gust blew by, and before he could react, a dark shadow had swooped about him, looping around him in circles. He immediately closed his eyes and clapped his hands together, stating his intent in a reverent and loud voice.\\n"O Great Suanni, ___ greets you! I came here simply to witness your majesty... and I brought lots of good food for your enjoyment, too! Now, ah, if you don\'t mind, could I open my eyes?"\\nHearing no more movement, he slowly re-opened his eyes, only to witness a large... difference between how he had imagined a Suanni to look and this cute little creature that sat proudly upon a giant stone.\\n"Whoa, seriously!? You\'re so tiny! And cute! Who\'s a good Suanni? That\'s right, you are! C\'mon, let me give you some headpats, and..."\\nIn his excitement, ___ overstepped and displeased the Suanni, and though it was indeed very small, it had an extraordinary energy about it, and like a furious flame it jumped all around the young man until he grew dizzy, the items he had brought dropping from his hands. Almost unconsciously, ___ grabbed at the beast head and began dueling the creature. What the Suanni would do, ___ would imitate, and so they continued from daylight till dusk — to a bystander, they might even have seemed like playmates meeting again after a long separation. Finally, the Suanni seemed to acknowledge him, and as it shook its head about, a shiny stone popped out of its mane.\\n"Really? A Vision, too? Is this what they mean by \'good things come in pairs\'?"\\nCarefully did ___ approach that stone, finding it to be an absolutely real, positively genuine chunk of ore that had only shone under the glare of the setting sun.\\nAh, a misunderstanding, then. It was a shame, of course, but it did not dampen his mood — indeed, it was from this moment that the "Mighty Mythical Beasts" troupe was formally founded.\\nFrom that day onward, ___ and Man Chai were inseparable, and he quickly forgot about that whole Vision affair...\\nSome time later, ___ was escorting a merchant caravan when he encountered a ruthless gang of bandits. The merchants advised him to retreat — lost cargo could be written off as a cost of business, but lost lives could not.\\n"Hah! I\'ve never been able to stand those who steal and rob for a living. Even if I wasn\'t on the job, I\'d give them a piece of my mind, and as it happens, making them regret their life choices is my job and I\'m on the clock. You go first, boss, and I\'ll hold the line here. I guarantee not one crate will be lost, nor will a single hair on your heads be harmed!"\\nThus did ___ go one against ten, and though he sustained numerous injuries, he persevered until all the brigands were bound, and both the Millelith and his colleagues had arrived, before allowing himself to slump over.\\nThe merchants would later inspect their goods, only to find that, indeed, not a single item was missing, and there was even something that had not been in the manifest — a Vision.\\nThey wrapped the item carefully before having it delivered, alongside the thank-you plaque they gave ___, to the Sword and Strongbox Agency.\\n___ was caught completely off-guard by the gem, with only surprise and not gladness registering in his heart, which was instead overwhelmed with a series of questions.\\n"What, really? Is this mine? I mean, I was just escorting some goods, nothing special. I mean, don\'t I do that every day?"\\n"Should I return it? But to whom? The caravan? No, wait, they said it wasn\'t theirs... Could it have been... that no-good low-down crook\'s?"\\n"No, no, what am I thinking! Well, in that case... I guess this Vision really maybe probably might be mine, then?"\\n"But I\'ve heard that they have to do with strong wishes.
